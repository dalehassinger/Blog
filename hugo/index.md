# Hugo | Static Site Generator


**Static Site Generator**

<!--more-->

---

I have reviewed and tried a lot of different ways to create a personal Blog so that I can share Code, Knowledge, Pictures and do Reviews. After spending some time with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) it has become the framework that I have liked the most.  The Theme ["Hugo Future Imperfect"](https://themes.gohugo.io/future-imperfect/) is also the Hugo Theme that I have liked the most.

Some of the ways I have reviewed creating a Blog require a monthly fee to host the web site for you. I am using [Github](https://github.com/) to host the web site where there is no monthly cost. I like how you can add Google Analytics code to all the pages within a Hugo Site. To add Google Analytics all you have to do is edit one line within the config.toml file.

To create the content for the Blog I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the files.  I have been reviewing [Forestry CMS](https://forestry.io/) to edit and create the pages.

To create the web pages Hugo is so FAST! It is the fastest file creation framework that I reviewed. Is is also very easy to use.

One of the main items I wanted a Blog site for, is to share code I create.  I could just create a Public Github repository, but that just isn't as pleasing to the eyes as a personal Blog can be.

The first person I know that created a Hugo site is [AdminWillie](https://adminwillie.github.io/). I met him at the Central PA VMUG meetings and I also started attending the Blair County Little Hacks that he organizes. A great example of the vCommunity sharing ideas.
