###### Presentation:

On **Friday, March 31, 2023,** I will be doing at Presentation at the **Philly VMUG**. [Click Here to register.](https://my.vmug.com/s/community-event?id=a1Y4x000002DEUEEA4)  

I am going to demo to the Philly VMUG Community, how to use **VMware Aria Automation** and **VMware Aria Operations** to create, manage and monitor VMs on-prem and in the cloud using the same VMware Aria Suite installation. Come see what working in a multi-cloud environment is like. 

###### Demo:

    <ul>
        <li>Create VMs on-prem and in the cloud</li>
        <li>Monitor VMs on-prem and in the cloud</li>
        <li>Use VMware Aria Automation Config to configure and maintain State on-prem and in the cloud.</li>
        <li>Stop the cloud chaos by using a single tool like VMware Aria for creation, management and monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
