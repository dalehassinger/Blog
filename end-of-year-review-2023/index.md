# End of Year Review - 2023


**End Of Year Review 2023**

<!--more-->

---

The year 2023 was a good chapter in my career, emphasizing the importance of community contribution. I hold a belief that my endeavors are worthwhile if they benefit even one person. This past year, I engaged in numerous presentations and blog posts, focusing on giving back to the vCommunity. My efforts in sharing knowledge and resources have, I believe, positively impacted others, making 2023 a year of success and meaningful community engagement.

The top 20 list reveals a significant interest in utilizing Automation and Operations. The fact that Ansible's integration with VMware Aria Automation ranked #1 was unexpected, evidenced by the frequent views of this particular blog post. This observation has inspired me to dedicate more of my blogging efforts to VMware Aria Automation Ansible integration in the upcoming year.
