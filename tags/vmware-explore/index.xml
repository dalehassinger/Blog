The Venetian Convention and Expo Center</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that I will be presenting three sessions at VMware Explore 2024! My journey to this moment began at the Mid-Atlantic HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) events. I initially attended these events as a VMware customer eager to learn. Eventually, I was invited to present on the automation work I was doing with VMware Products. Though nerve-wracking, my first presentation was a success, and the positive feedback encouraged me to start my blog, sharing knowledge with the vCommunity.</p>
<p>After countless blog posts and community events, I&rsquo;m now honored to present a General Session at VMware Explore 2024. For those in the VMware community, this is the pinnacle of recognition and opportunity. I&rsquo;m excited to bring my passion for VMware products to these sessions, and I invite you to sign up and join me. I&rsquo;ll do my best to share valuable insights and help you enhance your environments. Check out the links to my sessions below and in the <a href="https://event.vmware.com/flow/vmware/explore2024lv/content/page/catalog?search=Hassinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">VMware Explore 2024 Content Catalog</a>.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why I enjoy going to VMware Explore. First as a Customer. Now as a Employee.</strong></p>

<p>Website: <a href="https://www.vmware.com/explore/us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">VMware Explore 2024.</a><br>
Las Vegas Date: August 26 – 29, 2024<br>
The Venetian Convention and Expo Center<br>
Registration is open!</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="why-attend">Why Attend</h6>
<p><strong>When I was a VMware Customer, I tried to go to VMware Explore every year. Here is a list of reasons why I enjoyed the conference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet other people in the same field as myself. Exchange stories, ideas, contact information, etc.. The Community side of the event alone, is worth the cost to go.</li>
<li>To attend sessions that are done by people that you follow their blogs or socials, is an exciting experience.</li>
<li>The Key Note Sessions get you excited to see what is coming with the next releases of the VMware Products.</li>
<li>Vendor Parties are a great way to meet people and have good food and drink.</li>
<li>Other Highlights for evening Parties for me:
<ul>
<li>vExpert Party</li>
<li>VMUG Party</li>
<li>Event Concert on the last night (Black Keys Concert was my favorite)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>As a Employee my reasons are different to attend. Here is a list:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet people in person that I work with everyday. We are located across the country and don&rsquo;t get to meet in person. Even if we went into a office everyday, we would never get to meet.</li>
<li>Get Sessions accepted and share the knowledge with the products I work with every day. I like doing presentations on the Automation, Monitoring and Logging Products.</li>
<li>I like to participate in the Hackathon that is part of the conference. In 2023 my Team received 2nd place.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h6 id="sessions">Sessions</h6>
<p>I submitted a couple sessions that hope get accepted in 2024, Fingers Crossed. One session I will be presenting with a customer, and 2 sessions I included TAMs to present with me. I am excited about the topics. When the sessions get announced, check back on this blog. I will update what was accepted.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>VMware Explore 2022 | San Francisco</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>VMware Explore is always one of the premiere Technology Events every year. Here is a collection of links and tips to some of the activities that I would attend and enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always tried to attend the Keynotes to learn about new product announcements and to hear the direction that VMware was going.</li>
<li>I attended a lot of sessions. See list of sessions that I would enjoy.</li>
<li>I would do Hands on Labs that were not available to do anytime. There are some HOLs that are available only during the conference and there are VMware people to help you with the labs.</li>
<li>If you are a TAM customer, there are sessions dedicated to TAM customers.</li>
<li>Go to the Expo Area. You can always talk to VMware Engineers at the booths in the Expo Area and watch demos. A lot of Vendors in the Expo Area.</li>
<li>I would allows attend some of the vBrownbag Tech Talks. The Tech Talks were a 10 - 15 minute presentation.</li>
<li>Watch for Vendor Parties. They are always fun and drinks | food are always free. The Veeam party in the past was always one of the better parties.</li>
<li>See a McLaren F1 car in person, experience the speed of F1 in a fun simulator and learn how VMware helps McLaren F1 accelerate innovation.</li>
</ul>
