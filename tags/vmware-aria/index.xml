<hr>
<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The <strong>VMware Communities Podcast</strong> has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, <strong>Matt Langguth</strong>, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and &ldquo;Little Hacks&rdquo; hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at <strong>VMware Explore 2023</strong>, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a <strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> and talk about the presentation that I did in the <strong>VMware {code} Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a &ldquo;Little Hack&rdquo;, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Use VMware Aria to Create/Manage/Monitor Windows Servers (on-prem/cloud)</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I will be doing a VMware Explore 2023 Presentation. I did a virtual VMWorld presentation in 2021 but this will be my first VMware Explore Presentation that I will be doing &ldquo;Live&rdquo;. There will be many days going into this presentation so that the people attending will feel it was worth their time to learn about the topic. This is an awesome topic that I am very passionate about.</p>
<p>So register today for VMware Explore 2023 and attend my session.</p>

<hr>
<h6 id="vmware-explore-2023-hackathon">VMware Explore 2023 Hackathon:</h6>
<p>I will be participating in the VMware Explore 2023 Hackathon. I am the Team Captain for the &ldquo;Well Spoken&rdquo; Team. This Blog Post will be documenting the journey of the &ldquo;Well Spoken&rdquo; Team.</p>
<p>I want to thank Senior Staff TAM, <a href="https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ariel Sanchez</a>, for organizing the Team. Originally we were going to be part of Ariel&rsquo;s Team but there were too many people, so we split the Team in half. Ariel asked me to be the Captain of the 2nd Team. If you know Ariel, you know why he had too many people on his team.  Ariel is very active in the #vCommunity and does a great job promoting the #vCommunity. So when he asked on social platforms for people to join his team, there was instantly interest from a lot of people. Ariel has done a lot for me personally since I started working at VMware and I can&rsquo;t wait to meet him in person at the Hackathon.</p>

<p>I am so proud of what the &ldquo;Well-Spoken&rdquo; Team created together. There was great collaboration throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>The Team created a custom form in VMware Aria Automation that will help you build a chat question that would be sent to ChatGPT and return complete usable scripts to use with Automation.  The Scirpt returned could then be saved into a Teams/Slack Channel, GitHub Repository or a VMwaqre Aria Operations Dashboard.</p>
<p>This custom form will help customers get started with Automation and also convert existing Automation, like an Ansible Playbook, into a salt state file.</p>

<p>Creating a Blog Post every time I want to share a new code example or a new Dashboard Design can take a lot of time. To keep it simple for some items I want to share, I created a <a href="https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">GitHub Repository</a>. This will be a nice way for me to quickly add code more often. So go take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">GitHub Repository</a>, and check back often. I will continue to do the more detailed Blog Posts, but I will also add a lot of snippets of code to the repository to share with the vCommunity.</p>

    <title>How vRealize Operations can help with Right Sizing VMs</title>
    <link>https://www.vcrocs.info/vrealize-operations-right-size/</link>
    <pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 &#43;0000</pubDate>

    <description><![CDATA[<h5 id="using-vrops-data-to-help-show-app-owners-proper-vm-sizing">Using vROPS Data to help show APP Owners Proper VM Sizing:</h5>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>vRealize Operations does a good job to show you what the correct number for vCPU/Memory settings should be based on monitoring history. But instead of showing APP owners a screen that just shows what the current VM vCPU/Memory settings are and what the new settings &ldquo;Should&rdquo; be, I wanted to show the real data that proves why these changes should be made. It can still be hard for people to understand that taking away a VM resources can make performance better.  If a mechanic told you to replace a v-8 engine in a vehicle with a 4 cylinder to get more performance, would you believe them? Probably not!</p>
<p>vROPS Right Sizing does not just show you what vCPU to remove to make a VM performance better.  If a VM requires more vCPU resources there is a Metric CPU|Add that can be very useful.</p>
<h5 id="vrops-right-size-screen">vROPS Right Size Screen:</h5>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-05.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-05.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-05.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<div><b>VM Names were removed from screen Shot</b></div>
<hr>
<p>In vCenter if you look at the performance of a VM one of the options is to show CPU Ready|State (ms). I think this is a metric that you can show to an APP Owner and they can understand why this is important.</p>
<div><b>CPU Ready|State (ms):</b> "Time that the virtual machine was ready, but could not get scheduled to run on the physical CPU during last measurement interval"</b></div>

Here is a vROPS Dashboard that I created to show APP Owners Performance information and Right Sizing information in a "Single Pane of Glass". A question the APP Owners always ask is WHY should we take resources away from a VM to make the performance better. If you look at the Column CPU|Remove and then look at the column CPU|Ready (ms), the CPU|Ready (ms) is much higher on VMs that are <b>NOT</b> Right Sized.  
In one Dashboard I am showing several CPU performance metrics, vSAN performance metrics, CPU configuration (Counts/Hot ADD) and Right Sizing. I like to be able to look at all these metrics at the same time. Nice to be able to see if there is a relationship between performance, latency and Right Sizing. Does CPU performance affect the vSAN performance? Here is a VM that CPU|Remove is 0 and the CPU|Ready (ms) is much lower. Why is that?</div>
<div><br></div>
<p>Dashboard Screen Shot:</p>

<div><b>CPU | Ready (ms) metric after using vROPS Right Size recommendation:</b></div>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>This metric chart is showing a VM that had 12 CPU.  vROPS recommended that the CPU count be 10.  Before VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 1500 - 2000 (ms).  After the VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 500 - 600 (ms). If you would do this across 100s of VMs in a cluster you would see even more performance gains because then the &ldquo;Noisy Neighbors&rdquo; would not be as Noisy.</p>
<hr>
<div><b>Performance Values:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>CPU|Ready (ms) should be 1000 or less for best performance</li>
<li>CPU|Remove - I like to keep this at 2 or less.  For some applications this can be trial and error.</li>
<li>CPU|Add - I like to keep this at 0. Make sure the VM is sized with enough resources. Don&rsquo;t under size VMs. This will keep the APP Owners Happy!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<div><b>The next section was in an IBM KB article that I found helpful:</b></div>
<p>CPU ready time is a vSphere metric that records the amount of time a VM is ready to use CPU but was unable to schedule physical CPU time because all the vSphere ESXi host CPU resources are busy. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of VMs on the host and their CPU loads. It is normal for a VM to average between 0–50 ms of CPU ready time; anything over 1000 ms is considered to lead to VM performance problems.</p>
<p>VMs that are configured with multiple vCPUs will suffer from an increased amount of ready time than compared to VMs with fewer vCPUs configured. Ready time increases as the VM needs more vCPU resources to be made available at the same time and, therefore, may have to wait for extended times for all the required vCPUS to be free to be made available to the VM with more vCPUs.</p>
<hr>
<div><b>In Addition to Right Sizing</b>, I also think that <b>Optimizing</b> a VM is important. VMware has a Fling available that I like to use <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/vmware-os-optimization-tool?src=vmw_so_vex_pmasz_426" target="_blank">VMware OS Optimization Tool</a>
that helps you optimize CPU Settings.</div>
<hr>
<div><b>Dashboard Tips:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>Add Color to the list data to make poor performance values catch your eye. (I used Red)</li>
<li>Use Donut Charts to show some of the metrics that you feel are more important.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add color to List View values, use Show advanced settings for a metric:</p>
<div><br></div>
<a class="lightgallery" href="images/post/right-size-09.png" title="images/post/right-size-09.png" data-thumbnail="images/post/right-size-09.png">

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>  
<p>Enter the metric values when you want the color to change:</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>I like using Donut Charts in Dashboards. You can show a lot of data in a small amount of screen space. Using colors also catches your eye quickly when there are issues:</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<hr>
<p>When I write about Automation I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task.  Monitoring is the same way.  I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization will be different.  Add/Remove columns in the Dashboard to suite you needs. There is no right or wrong way to monitor. Maybe other metrics make more sense to you. What is important with monitoring is don&rsquo;t install vRealize Operation and not use it. Don&rsquo;t make vROPS Shelfware! This is a GREAT Tool that shows you so much information about your virtual environment. And it keeps getting better&hellip;</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The New Features I use the most.</strong></p>
<hr>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Donut Charts.
<ul>
<li>This is one of my favorite new features.</li>
<li>The donut chart allows you to show a lot of information in a smaller space and makes the Dashboards look more modern and clean looking.</li>
<li>I have been replacing the Heat Map Widgets on some of my custom Dashboards with Donut Charts.</li>
<li>If you click on the colors of the Donut charts you will then get a list of the data that makes up that color.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top-N Chart and Color Method.
<ul>
<li>Adding color to the Top-N makes it so much more usable. With the previous version where is was just blue it didn&rsquo;t grab your eye like adding the color.</li>
<li>Using the Top-N chart and the Donut chart together makes a GREAT looking Dashboard. See my example below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ping Monitoring.
<ul>
<li>This feature always us to monitor non VMware devices. In a short period of time I learned a lot about latency and packet drops in our environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Troubleshooting Workbench.
<ul>
<li>In previous versions of vROPS I would create Dashboards to help with trouble shooting.</li>
<li>With Trouble Shooting work bench I don&rsquo;t need to create those custom Dashboards anymore.</li>
<li>The included Trouble Shooting workbench is like what I did on steroids.</li>
</ul>
</li>

    <title>How to use PowerShell Modules with vRA 8.2</title>
    <link>https://www.vcrocs.info/vra-82-powershell-host/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Options to use PowerShell Modules</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I like to review VMware vRA (vRealize Automation) 8.2 as a Microsoft Windows Server Admin.  Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I create Windows/Linux VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.x, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell.</p>
<p>In my vRA 7.6 environment, I use a PowerShell Host to run processes and on the PowerShell Host is where I install all the PS Modules that I use. When I started looking at how to use PowerShell with vRA 8.2 the one item that I needed to understand was how to use PowerShell Modules. VMware does have a Blog Post on how to include PowerShell modules with ABX Actions/vRO Work Flows - <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2020/07/how-to-abx-vro-powershell-additional-modules.html" target="_blank">Click Here to see the Blog Post</a>. After doing some testing and reviewing my options I decided to continue to use a PowerShell Host with vRA 8.2. What this allows me to do is use the same exact PowerShell Host for 7.6 and 8.2. The existing PS scripts that I have also work with both 7.6 and 8.2. No changes to any scripts and the PS Host. I like how VMware included PS as an options for all scripts within vRA 8.2. Hopefully in the future VMware will allow you to install your own PS Modules directly in the vRA Appliance. The one item that some people may not like about this setup is it does require an additional Windows Server that a standard vRA setup does not require. But to be able to use an existing Windows PS Host that can be shared between vRA 7.6 and 8.2 until I get my environment to 100% vRA 8.2 also has it positives. With Automation there is always many ways to complete the same task.</p>
<p>I wrote a Blog Post previously that describes how to pass Cloud Template inputs/properties to ABX Actions. This Post is really using that same technique but instead of only running an ABX Action, this ABX Action Script is passing the inputs/customproperties onto a PowerShell Host. Here is link to previous post: <a href="https://www.vcrocs.info/blog/vra81-abx-ps/" target="_blank">VREALIZE AUTOMATION 8.2 - POWERSHELL ABX</a>. By passing the custom properties as parameters to a PS Host I can also use PS Modules to connect to SQL servers and many other options. Basically any PS Module that is available can be used.</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="details-on-how-to-use-a-abx-script-with-a-powershell-host">Details on how to use a ABX Script with a PowerShell Host:</h6>
<div style="background-color:#d9d9d9; Padding:20px;" >
<b>Step 1:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Create a Cloud Template. (See included yaml code and screen shot).</li>
  <li>Create inputs for the parameters you need to send to a PS script that will run on the PS Host. The inputs are the values that are used for the resource/properties. (See included yaml code)</li>
  <li>Create Properties in the resources section of the yaml for the inputs you just created. These properties will be the parameters that get passed to the PS Script. The properties get passed to the ABX script using $payload. (See included PS code)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<b>Step 2:</b>
  <li>Create a PowerShell ABX Action. (See included PS code and screen shot)</li>
  <li>To get the custom properties from the Cloud Template you need to use $payload.</li>
  <li>$payload.customProperties."Properties Name" is how you get the values from the $payload.</li>
  <li>You can assign the custom properties to a variable within the ABX PS code.</li>
  <li>I use Invoke-VMScript to run the PS Script on the PS Host because my environment is also a Zero Trust Environment. Invoke-VMScript allows me to run PS scripts on remote servers without opening ports to the remote servers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<b>Step 3:</b>
  <li>Create a Subscription. See Screenshot.</li>
  <li>The subscription is want runs the ABX scripts.</li>
  <li>A subscription can be Fired before or after a compute resource gets provisioned.  I create a subscription for both in my environment.</li>
  <li>Within the subscription is where you define which ABX script is run. If you would want to string several ABX scripts together, the subscription could also run a ABX Flow.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h6 id="sample-code-and-screen-shots">Sample Code and Screen Shots:</h6>
<h6 id="cloud-template">Cloud Template:</h6>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vra-82-powershell-host/pshost-01.PNG" title="/vra-82-powershell-host/pshost-01.PNG" data-thumbnail="/vra-82-powershell-host/pshost-01.PNG" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The properties under resources in the yaml code will be used like parameters in a PS Script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties. When you deploy the Cloud Template, the values entered that I defined will not be used until the ABX script runs. The ABX Script will run after the subscription is triggered. The values will be passed from the Cloud Template to the ABX Script using $payload.  Just like passing parameters to a PS script.</p>

<p>In my PowerShell code I am using Write-Host to help show how the Cloud Template passes values to the ABX Action using the $payload. I use the code to troubleshoot and understand how it is working. I am able to take values from the payload customProperties and assign to variables. The customProperties are defined in the Cloud Template yaml code as resources/properties. I can then make decisions in the code based on these values. For production the write-host lines could be removed.</p>

<div style="background-color:#9ae59a; Padding:20px;" ><b>Lessons Learned:</b>
<ul>
  <li>vRA 7.6 and 8.2 can share the same PS Host and Scripts.</li>
  <li>A lot of the PowerShell code and logic I use in vRA 7.6 will be able to be reused/shared.</li>
  <li>Using a PS Host does require an additional VM.</li>
  <li>Within ABX scripts I have always changed the default "Custom limits and retry options". I set the "Memory Limit" to 1024 and "Timeouts" to 900.</li>
  <li>Anytime I speak to others about Automation the one item I stress is there is no right way or wrong way to accomplish your tasks. Build on the skills that your Team already has. The environment I work in is 90% Windows Servers so we use PowerShell a lot. That is why I needed to be able to use all the PS Modules that I have installed on the PS Host.</li>

    <title>Creating Charts with ChartJS and displaying in vRealize Operations</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Creating Charts with ChartJS and displaying in vRealize Operations</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I like the idea of using VMware vRealize Operations as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring.  The Citrix Team recently asked me if I could show license usage within vRealize Operations. They wanted to see the highest usage in the last 30 days, 10 days and 24 hours. Citrix license usage is not built into vROPS but I have used the “Text Display Widget” to show other information within vROPS.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a half donut chart to show the highest license usage in the last 30 days, a horizontal bar chart to show the last 10 days and a table to show the last 24 hours.  I reviewed to see what “Open Source” Javascript options were available and I found ChartJS. After reviewing how to program the files to create charts with ChartJS I liked the solution.</p>

<li>Read all the documentation on how to create ChartJS files.  Very important steps need to be followed.</li>
<li>All the Web pages to show Citrix Licence counts are updated very hour.</li>
<li>The process to update the Web Pages is scheduled with vRealize Automation Orchestrator.</li>
<li>The code to get the license information and create the web pages is all done with PowerShell.</li>
<li>The License values collected every hour are saved in a Microsoft SQL Database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process to save the data and create the web pages can be done many different ways. I outlined how I do it in my environment. What I feel was important to show was the finished HTML code to create the ChartJS Web Pages that I display in vRealize Operations.  The data could be from any source that makes sense in your environment. This makes a great way to graphically show data within vROPS from data that is saved outside of vROPS.</p>

    <title>Text Display Widget - More Powerful than just displaying text on a Dashboard...</title>
    <link>https://www.vcrocs.info/text-display-widget/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>vRealize Operations - Dashboards:</strong></p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>I was recently reviewing some sample custom vRealize Operations Dashboards and I seen where some of the Dashboards had custom text and images.  I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget.</p>
<p>The first thought I had was to display the weather for both the data center locations where I work.  This could be used with a NOC type Dashboard.  I looked online for a weather widget site and got the code to display the weather for the specific locations. If you go to Administration/Configuration/Metric Configurations/TxtWidgetContent you can create html files to save the widget code. See examples in images below. You can display any Widget data from any web site that provides widgets using the &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget.</p>
<p>After I successfully added weather widgets I wanted to get more serious and show data from a SQL Database. I use a SQL database to store data from some vRealize Automation Day 2 BluePrints that I created. Some example BluePrints where I store data in a SQL DB are Server Builds and Server Decomissions. I created a web page that displayed the SQL Data and added another “Text Display” widget to the Dashboard.  I used the url of the web page and assigned it to the widget and now I am also able to show SQL Data on a Dashboard.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to show Weather and SQL data is to use vRealize Operations Dashboards as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring. I have never seen a demo from VMware to use the “Text Display” Widget this way but I think this is awesome. This could completely change the way I use vRealize Operations Dashboards. There are not always vRealize Operations Management Packs available and this provides a cool way to show any data on a Dashboard.  The data will be for reference only but it does allow the &ldquo;Single Pane of Glass&rdquo;.</p>

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The url web page could be a static or dynamic page. Use whatever works best for you.  I think this opens up so many possibilities of what you can display on a Custom Dashboard. If you want to take it a step further you could publish the Custom vRealize Operations Dashboard with Workspace One and provide the data to anyone in your organization even if they are not a vRealize Operations user.  Cool Shit!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget should be renamed to the &ldquo;Cool Shit&rdquo; Widget!</p>

    <title>vRealize Automation 8.1 - PowerShell ABX</title>
    <link>https://www.vcrocs.info/vra81-abx-ps/</link>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Options to use PowerShell Modules</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I wanted to review VMware vRA (vRealize Automation) 8.x as a Microsoft Windows Server Admin.  Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I am going to create Windows Server VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.1, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. No vRO (Orchestrator) Workflows will be used. This is completely different compared to how I create Windows Servers with vRA 7.6.</p>
<p>The enterprise organizations that I have worked for are 90%+ Microsoft Windows Servers.  It is important for me to have vRA be able to create Windows Servers and make all configuration changes using PowerShell.</p>
<p>You could also use this technique to make changes to a Linux VM using the PowerCLI commands Invoke-VMscript and Copy-VMGuestFile. I did create a <a href="../automation-zero-trust/" rel="">Blog Post</a> on this topic.</p>
<h6 id="blueprint-requirements">BluePrint Requirements:</h6>
<p>I want to manually enter the VM Name.  I don’t want an auto generated name. After the Windows Server VM is created I want to to able to add vCenter TAGS to VM, make some OS changes, and install software based on values entered on the BluePrint.</p>
<h6 id="what-i-created-to-accomplish-the-requirements">What I created to accomplish the requirements:</h6>
<p>Created a BluePrint. See included code and screen shot.</p>
<p>Created a PowerShell Action. See included code and screen shot.</p>
<p>Created a Subscription. See Screenshot.</p>
<h6 id="sample-code-and-screen-shots---">Sample Code and Screen Shots:&mdash;</h6>
<h6 id="blueprint">BluePrint:</h6>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vra81-abx-ps/vra81-01.jpg" title="/vra81-abx-ps/vra81-01.jpg" data-thumbnail="/vra81-abx-ps/vra81-01.jpg" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The properties under resources in the yaml code can be used like parameters in a PowerShell script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties. When you deploy the BluePrint the values entered that I defined will not be used until the Action runs. The Action will run after the “Compute post provision” event is triggered with the subscription. Those values will be passed from the BluePrint to the Action.  Just like passing parameters to a PS script.</p>

</div><p>&mdash;Using the Inputs Screen helps you build the BluePrint yaml code.  I found this very useful since I am still learning the proper yaml formatting.</p>

<p>In my PowerShell code I am using Write-Host to help me understand how the BluePrint passes values to the Action. I use to troubleshoot and understand how it is working. I am able to take values from the payload customProperties and assign to variables. The customProperties are defined in the BluePrint yaml code as resources/properties. I can then make decisions in the code based on these values.</p>

<h6 id="lets-compare-vra-76-vs-81">Lets compare vRA 7.6 vs 8.1</h6>
<p>vRA 7.6:</p>
<p>I would create a BluePrint with a custom form in vRA 7.6. I would pass the field values from the custom form as parameters to a PowerShell script on a PowerShell Host.</p>
<p>vRA 8.1:</p>
<p>Using ABX and a subscription in vRA 8.1 eliminates the need to have a Windows PowerShell host and the PowerShell script has no parameters. The vRA 8.x appliance is the PowerShell Host. Less moving parts to complete a Windows Server Build in vRA 8.1.</p>
<h6 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned:</h6>
<ul>
<li>I will need to learn yaml.</li>
<li>The process to Create BluePrints will be much different in vRA 8.x.</li>
<li>A lot of the PowerShell code and logic I use in vRA 7.6 will be able to be reused.</li>
<li>I will not need as many VMs for the installation and administration of vRA 8.x.</li>
