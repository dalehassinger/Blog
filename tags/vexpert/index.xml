<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The <strong>VMware Communities Podcast</strong> has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, <strong>Matt Langguth</strong>, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and &ldquo;Little Hacks&rdquo; hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at <strong>VMware Explore 2023</strong>, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a <strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> and talk about the presentation that I did in the <strong>VMware {code} Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a &ldquo;Little Hack&rdquo;, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <title>The PowerShell Podcast | I was a Guest on the show</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The PowerShell Podcast | I was a Guest on the show</strong></p>
<hr>
<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. This past year, I started listening to a new podcast, <strong>&ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo;</strong>. This podcast has become one of my favorites that I listen to every week. The hosts (<strong>Andrew Pla</strong> and <strong>Jordan Hammond</strong>) are funny, the content interests me a lot, and the list of guests has been awesome. The guests are people that I have read their books or use their PowerShell Modules to complete automation.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to join the podcast as a guest, to share how I use PowerShell with VMware products. VMware has a PowerShell Module, PowerCLI, that I use with almost all automation that I create. With VMware Aria Automation, you can use PowerShell with Workflows, Actions, and have salt execute PowerShell scripts with state files and functions. So I reached out to the hosts of &ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo; and showed my interest to be a guest on the Podcast. They thought that my story would make a good episode, so we scheduled a time to record. The experience to record the podcast episode was great. The behind the scenes was funny. The guests talk to each other the same way they do when when recording an episode. They make you feel comfortable as a guest.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <title>What have I been up to? | 2nd half 2022</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>New Job | August 2022 | Technical Account Manager (TAM)</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>On August 1, 2022 I became an employee of <strong>VMware</strong> as a <strong>Technical Account Manager, TAM</strong>.</p>
<p>I was hired to be a TAM with a focus on the <strong>vRealize Suite</strong>. Within a month of my hire date VMware announced <strong>VMware Aria</strong>. So now I am a TAM with a focus on the VMware Aria Product.</p>
<p>To work for VMware was a career goal of mine. I was always impressed by the VMware employees that I worked with the past 10+ years. Everyone was always very professional and had a great attitude to help their customers. I wanted to know personally what it was like to work in that type of culture. If you know me you know that I have a passion for the VMware Aria suite of Products. So to be a TAM with a focus on Aria is a good fit for me.</p>
<p>After several months at VMware, this is what I learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>culture</strong> overall is very positive. A lot of people helped me in my on-boarding and wanted to see me be successful. People that I knew before I joined VMware reached out to me and said &ldquo;What can I do to help you&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The employee <strong>benefits</strong> are the best that I ever had in my career so far.</li>
<li>You get to do a lot of <strong>training</strong> to keep your skills up to date and at a level the customers expect.</li>
<li>The on-boarding process can take days, weeks, months&hellip;</li>
<li>To get started I received a laptop of my choice 3 days before my start date. Never experienced that before.</li>
<li>Having a <strong>Mentor</strong> at <strong>VMware</strong> is very important. Someone that wants to help you be successful and will take the time to show you how to do your job, recommend training, help you pick benefits, let you know about different programs to get involved with, let you know about weekly zoom training sessions, help you get a lab setup, etc&hellip;</li>
<li>VMware wants all employees to <strong>give back</strong> by making donations to non-profits, 100% match by VMware.</li>
<li>VMware wants all employees to <strong>donate</strong> time to non-profits.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Special thanks</strong> to some people that went above and beyond when I started at VMware to help me, in no particular order:</p>
<p>Marshall Cline, Ariel Sanchez, Brock Peterson, Cosmin Trif, Christopher Kusek, Anton Wesztergom, Alex Musicante, Chad Thomas, David Kruse, Steve Lieberson, Paul Schlosser, Christina Griffus and some I may have missed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now that I am getting more engaged with the customers that I will be working with, I plan to start blogging more again to continue giving back to the vCommunity. Share the knowledge!</p>
<p>If anyone that reads my blogs would ever want to talk to me about being a VMware employee, please reach out to me. I will share my experience 1:1.</p>
<p>Another area that I want to give back to the vCommunity is to help Mentor others. If anyone wants to ever talk, please reach out.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>VMware Explore 2022 | San Francisco</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>VMware Explore is always one of the premiere Technology Events every year. Here is a collection of links and tips to some of the activities that I would attend and enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always tried to attend the Keynotes to learn about new product announcements and to hear the direction that VMware was going.</li>
<li>I attended a lot of sessions. See list of sessions that I would enjoy.</li>
<li>I would do Hands on Labs that were not available to do anytime. There are some HOLs that are available only during the conference and there are VMware people to help you with the labs.</li>
<li>If you are a TAM customer, there are sessions dedicated to TAM customers.</li>
<li>Go to the Expo Area. You can always talk to VMware Engineers at the booths in the Expo Area and watch demos. A lot of Vendors in the Expo Area.</li>
<li>I would allows attend some of the vBrownbag Tech Talks. The Tech Talks were a 10 - 15 minute presentation.</li>
<li>Watch for Vendor Parties. They are always fun and drinks | food are always free. The Veeam party in the past was always one of the better parties.</li>
<li>See a McLaren F1 car in person, experience the speed of F1 in a fun simulator and learn how VMware helps McLaren F1 accelerate innovation.</li>
</ul>

<li>If your schedule gives you some free time there is a lot of cool stuff to do and see in the SanFrancisco area.</li>

<li>One year I rented a bike and rode across the Golden Gate Bridge. That was a fun experience.</li>
<li>To rent a car and go see the Red Wood trees was fun.</li>
