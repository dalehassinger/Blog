<h6 id="why-attend">Why Attend</h6>
<p><strong>When I was a VMware Customer, I tried to go to VMware Explore every year. Here is a list of reasons why I enjoyed the conference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet other people in the same field as myself. Exchange stories, ideas, contact information, etc.. The Community side of the event alone, is worth the cost to go.</li>
<li>To attend sessions that are done by people that you follow their blogs or socials, is an exciting experience.</li>
<li>The Key Note Sessions get you excited to see what is coming with the next releases of the VMware Products.</li>
<li>Vendor Parties are a great way to meet people and have good food and drink.</li>
<li>Other Highlights for evening Parties for me:
<ul>
<li>vExpert Party</li>
<li>VMUG Party</li>
<li>Event Concert on the last night (Black Keys Concert was my favorite)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>As a Employee my reasons are different to attend. Here is a list:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To meet people in person that I work with everyday. We are located across the country and don&rsquo;t get to meet in person. Even if we went into a office everyday, we would never get to meet.</li>
<li>Get Sessions accepted and share the knowledge with the products I work with every day. I like doing presentations on the Automation, Monitoring and Logging Products.</li>
<li>I like to participate in the Hackathon that is part of the conference. In 2023 my Team received 2nd place.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h6 id="sessions">Sessions</h6>
<p>I submitted a couple sessions that hope get accepted in 2024, Fingers Crossed. One session I will be presenting with a customer, and 2 sessions I included TAMs to present with me. I am excited about the topics. When the sessions get announced, check back on this blog. I will update what was accepted.</p>
