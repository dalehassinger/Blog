      <description>Smart Desk: Like most people that work in the Technology Field I have been &amp;ldquo;WFH&amp;rdquo; (Working From Home) since the beginning of March. I already had a dedicated office area but it wasn’t setup for full time employment. I always liked a L-Shaped desk and I had this layout by pushing to straight desks together. Worked OK but could use improvement.
So I started looking at new desks. I had two requirements, L-Shaped and I also wanted my next desk to be a standup Desk.</description>
