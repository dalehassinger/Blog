<p>2024 is the 4th year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram and the 1st year for vExpert vSphere.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m immensely honored to be included in the VMware vExpert program once again, marking my fifth year of participation. The aspect of the vExpert program I find particularly commendable is its focus on acknowledging individuals for their contributions and dedication to &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;. Being chosen for the vExpert program signifies a commitment to sharing knowledge and a desire to elevate not just oneself but also those within the vCommunity.</p>
<p>As an employee of Broadcom By VMware, one of my primary ambitions is to contribute more significantly to the vCommunity than I could as a user of VMware products.</p>
<hr>
<p>I did more for the vCommunity in 2023 than any previous years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>VMware Explore 2023 Presentation</strong> | Use VMware Aria to Create/Manage/Monitor Windows Servers (on-prem/cloud) [CODE2501LV]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> (Finished in 2nd Place) | VMware Explore 2023</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Philly VMUG - 2023</strong> | VMware Aria Automation and Operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The PowerShell Podcast</strong> | “Using PowerCLI with Dale Hassinger”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VMware Community Podcast</strong> #659</p>

<h6 id="what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program">What is the VMware vExpert Program?</h6>
<h6 id="program-overview">Program Overview</h6>
<p>The VMware vExpert program is VMware&rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.</p>
<h6 id="criteria">Criteria</h6>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="thanks">Thanks:</h6>
<p>I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present. I would like to thank everyone that has helped me on my journey called a career.</p>

<hr>
<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The <strong>VMware Communities Podcast</strong> has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, <strong>Matt Langguth</strong>, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and &ldquo;Little Hacks&rdquo; hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at <strong>VMware Explore 2023</strong>, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a <strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> and talk about the presentation that I did in the <strong>VMware {code} Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a &ldquo;Little Hack&rdquo;, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The PowerShell Podcast | I was a Guest on the show</strong></p>
<hr>
<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. This past year, I started listening to a new podcast, <strong>&ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo;</strong>. This podcast has become one of my favorites that I listen to every week. The hosts (<strong>Andrew Pla</strong> and <strong>Jordan Hammond</strong>) are funny, the content interests me a lot, and the list of guests has been awesome. The guests are people that I have read their books or use their PowerShell Modules to complete automation.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to join the podcast as a guest, to share how I use PowerShell with VMware products. VMware has a PowerShell Module, PowerCLI, that I use with almost all automation that I create. With VMware Aria Automation, you can use PowerShell with Workflows, Actions, and have salt execute PowerShell scripts with state files and functions. So I reached out to the hosts of &ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo; and showed my interest to be a guest on the Podcast. They thought that my story would make a good episode, so we scheduled a time to record. The experience to record the podcast episode was great. The behind the scenes was funny. The guests talk to each other the same way they do when when recording an episode. They make you feel comfortable as a guest.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

<p>I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program.  This is the fourth year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.</p>
<p>One of my goals as an VMware employee is to be able to give more back to the vCommunity than I was able to as an end user of the VMware Products.</p>
<p>2023 is also the 3rd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram.</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program">What is the VMware vExpert Program?</h6>
<h6 id="program-overview">Program Overview</h6>
<p>The VMware vExpert program is VMware&rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.</p>
<h6 id="criteria">Criteria</h6>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community.

<hr>
<p>VMware Explore is always one of the premiere Technology Events every year. Here is a collection of links and tips to some of the activities that I would attend and enjoy.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always tried to attend the Keynotes to learn about new product announcements and to hear the direction that VMware was going.</li>
<li>I attended a lot of sessions. See list of sessions that I would enjoy.</li>
<li>I would do Hands on Labs that were not available to do anytime. There are some HOLs that are available only during the conference and there are VMware people to help you with the labs.</li>
<li>If you are a TAM customer, there are sessions dedicated to TAM customers.</li>
<li>Go to the Expo Area. You can always talk to VMware Engineers at the booths in the Expo Area and watch demos. A lot of Vendors in the Expo Area.</li>
<li>I would allows attend some of the vBrownbag Tech Talks. The Tech Talks were a 10 - 15 minute presentation.</li>
<li>Watch for Vendor Parties. They are always fun and drinks | food are always free. The Veeam party in the past was always one of the better parties.</li>
<li>See a McLaren F1 car in person, experience the speed of F1 in a fun simulator and learn how VMware helps McLaren F1 accelerate innovation.</li>

<p>I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program.  This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.</p>
<p>2022 is also the 2nd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram.</p>
<p>I think that 2021 was one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.</p>

<h6 id="what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program">What is the VMware vExpert Program?</h6>
<h6 id="program-overview">Program Overview</h6>
<p>The VMware vExpert program is VMware&rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.</p>
<h6 id="criteria">Criteria</h6>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="thanks">Thanks:</h6>
<p>I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present. I would like to thank the following people for all their support in no particular order: Steve Leiberson, Karl Hauck, Cosmin Trif, Brock Peterson, Kevin Holland, Daniel Thomas, Marcus Roberts, Paul Schlosser.</p>
<p>Special Thanks to David Kruse for getting me started with vRA.</p>
<p>Special Thanks to some past co-workers, SEs, TAMs, HVC Members that I learned a lot from: Kirk Shaffer, Robert Mitchell, Dan Grove, Steve Holmes, Steve Pittenger, Anton Wesztergom (Opened my eyes to vRA Day 2).</p>
<p>List of Bloggers that I follow and have learned a lot by them &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;: Cody De Arkland, Luc Dekens, Kyle Ruddy, William Lam, Nathen Bennett, Vince Wood, Alan Renouf.</p>
<p>Special Thanks to the person that gave me my first Job in IT: David Cornelius</p>
<p>and anyone else that helped me in my journey called my career&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>I have learned a lot from the vCommunity. I want to use this blog as a way for me to &ldquo;give back&rdquo;. If one person finds anything I post helpful I will consider my efforts successful. I am always open to talking to any person, group or organization about what I do with VMware products.  Please reach out to me if you ever want to have a discussion.</p>
