      <description>I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this blog as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful.

      <description>vExpert Cloud Management 
I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert subprogram &amp;ldquo;Cloud Management&amp;rdquo;. This is the first year that I was accepted into the subprogram.
Almost all my blog posts and talks that I give are about one of the vRealize Products. The (2) Products that I use the most are vRealize Automation and Operations but I will be writing about more of the other Products.</description>

      <description>vExpert 2020, 2021          VMware vExpert 2020,2021    I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program. This is the second year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that this recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. I have crossed paths with people throughout my career that didn&amp;rsquo;t like sharing what they know.</description>
