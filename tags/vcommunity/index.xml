      <description>vExpert 2020, 2021          VMware vExpert 2020,2021    I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program. This is the second year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that this recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. I have crossed paths with people throughout my career that didn&amp;rsquo;t like sharing what they know.</description>
