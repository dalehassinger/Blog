<p>2024 is the 4th year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram and the 1st year for vExpert vSphere.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;m immensely honored to be included in the VMware vExpert program once again, marking my fifth year of participation. The aspect of the vExpert program I find particularly commendable is its focus on acknowledging individuals for their contributions and dedication to &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;. Being chosen for the vExpert program signifies a commitment to sharing knowledge and a desire to elevate not just oneself but also those within the vCommunity.</p>
<p>As an employee of Broadcom By VMware, one of my primary ambitions is to contribute more significantly to the vCommunity than I could as a user of VMware products.</p>
<hr>
<p>I did more for the vCommunity in 2023 than any previous years.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>VMware Explore 2023 Presentation</strong> | Use VMware Aria to Create/Manage/Monitor Windows Servers (on-prem/cloud) [CODE2501LV]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> (Finished in 2nd Place) | VMware Explore 2023</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Philly VMUG - 2023</strong> | VMware Aria Automation and Operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The PowerShell Podcast</strong> | “Using PowerCLI with Dale Hassinger”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>VMware Community Podcast</strong> #659</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blogs:</strong> | More Blogs than any previous year</p>

<h6 id="what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program">What is the VMware vExpert Program?</h6>
<h6 id="program-overview">Program Overview</h6>
<p>The VMware vExpert program is VMware&rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.</p>
<h6 id="criteria">Criteria</h6>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.</p>
<hr>
<h6 id="thanks">Thanks:</h6>
<p>I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present. I would like to thank everyone that has helped me on my journey called a career.</p>

<p>I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program.  This is the fourth year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &ldquo;Giving Back&rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.</p>
<p>One of my goals as an VMware employee is to be able to give more back to the vCommunity than I was able to as an end user of the VMware Products.</p>
<p>2023 is also the 3rd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram.</p>
