        <description>&lt;img src="https://vcrocs.info/vmware-vexpert-2025-sixth-year/featured-image.png" alt="Featured image of post VMware vExpert 2025 | Sixth Year" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VMware vExpert 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent contributions turn recognition into impact—community thrives when knowledge is shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VMware vExpert 2020–Present&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I was also selected for the &lt;strong&gt;vExpert VCF&lt;/strong&gt; subprogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vExpert Subprograms:&lt;br&gt;
•	vExpert VCF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This marks my sixth consecutive year as a &lt;strong&gt;VMware vExpert&lt;/strong&gt; and the first year participating in the &lt;strong&gt;vExpert VCF&lt;/strong&gt; subprogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being recognized again as a &lt;strong&gt;VMware vExpert&lt;/strong&gt; highlights a continued commitment to community engagement and knowledge sharing. The vExpert program is centered around recognizing individuals who contribute meaningfully to the VMware ecosystem and the broader vCommunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selected 2024 vCommunity Contributions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
•	Presented at VMware Explore 2024 (5 sessions)&lt;br&gt;
•	Hackathon Team Captain – 2nd Place, VMware Explore 2024&lt;br&gt;
•	Blogging – Published more articles in 2024 than any previous year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the VMware vExpert Program:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VMware vExpert Program is a global evangelism and advocacy initiative. It provides recognition and marketing support to individuals who actively share their knowledge and expertise with the community. Benefits include article promotion, visibility at global events, access to beta programs, and insight into VMware’s roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program awards are individual-based and valid for one year. Both partner and customer employees are eligible. Applications are evaluated based on contributions from the past year, or both past and current activities in the case of second-half applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Program Criteria:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;vExpert recognition is based on community involvement that goes beyond day-to-day responsibilities. Examples of accepted contributions include blogging, authoring books or articles, public speaking, participating in forums, leading VMUGs, producing videos, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledgments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the support and collaboration from colleagues at Broadcom, past and present. Thank you to everyone who has been part of my professional journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vmware-vexpert-2020---present&#34;&gt;VMware vExpert 2020 - Present
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been included in (2) vExpert Subprograms in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vexpert-subprograms&#34;&gt;vExpert Subprograms:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vExpert Cloud Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vExpert vSphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 is the 4th year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram and the 1st year for vExpert vSphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m immensely honored to be included in the VMware vExpert program once again, marking my fifth year of participation. The aspect of the vExpert program I find particularly commendable is its focus on acknowledging individuals for their contributions and dedication to &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. Being chosen for the vExpert program signifies a commitment to sharing knowledge and a desire to elevate not just oneself but also those within the vCommunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an employee of Broadcom By VMware, one of my primary ambitions is to contribute more significantly to the vCommunity than I could as a user of VMware products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did more for the vCommunity in 2023 than any previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VMware Explore 2023 Presentation&lt;/strong&gt; | Use VMware Aria to Create/Manage/Monitor Windows Servers (on-prem/cloud) [CODE2501LV]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hackathon Team Captain&lt;/strong&gt; (Finished in 2nd Place) | VMware Explore 2023&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philly VMUG - 2023&lt;/strong&gt; | VMware Aria Automation and Operations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PowerShell Podcast&lt;/strong&gt; | “Using PowerCLI with Dale Hassinger”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VMware Community Podcast&lt;/strong&gt; #659&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogs:&lt;/strong&gt; | More Blogs than any previous year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program&#34;&gt;What is the VMware vExpert Program?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;program-overview&#34;&gt;Program Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VMware vExpert program is VMware&amp;rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&amp;rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&amp;rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&amp;rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria&#34;&gt;Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term &amp;ldquo;giving back&amp;rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present. I would like to thank everyone that has helped me on my journey called a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program.  This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 is also the 2nd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that 2021 was one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;highlights-of-2021-to-get-accepted-into-the-vexpert-program&#34;&gt;Highlights of 2021 to get accepted into the vExpert Program:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMworld 2021 session (Presentation): Manage Windows Workloads Through vRealize Automation SaltStack Config [MCL1895]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SaltConf21 session (Presentation): Managing Windows with SaltStack Config&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(6) of my personal Blogs were shared by the VMware “vExpert Cloud Management Community” on the Vmware Blog Web Site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did several vRealize Automation Presentations at VMware HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) Events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerBlock Customer Showcase - VM “Right Sizing”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I did a VMware Customer Reference Interview that will be released in 2022. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/management/2022/03/vra-optimize-healthcare-outcomes.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Link to Customer Reference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-vmware-vexpert-program&#34;&gt;What is the VMware vExpert Program?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;program-overview&#34;&gt;Program Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VMware vExpert program is VMware&amp;rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware&amp;rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware&amp;rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year&amp;rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;criteria&#34;&gt;Criteria
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term &amp;ldquo;giving back&amp;rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
