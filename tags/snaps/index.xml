<li>I want to extend my gratitude to Christopher Kusek for inviting me to collaborate on this video, which we are excited to share on his YouTube channel.</li>
<li>Christopher has been a mentor to me from the moment I stepped into VMware. In my very first week at the company, even before we became colleagues on the same team, Christopher reached out to me and initiated a Zoom session. He expressed his genuine commitment to ensuring my success at VMware and offered valuable insights and guidance. Now that we&rsquo;re both part of the same team, Christopher&rsquo;s support continues to be an asset in my daily journey. Throughout one&rsquo;s career, there are individuals who leave a lasting impact, and Christopher Kusek has played that role in mine. I will forever appreciate his guidance and cherish the friendship we&rsquo;ve built.</li>
<li>In this video, I&rsquo;d like to acknowledge that some of the knowledge I&rsquo;m sharing today was by fellow members of my team. We have a Slack channel where mutual support is a way of life. The culture within my team is nothing short of remarkable; it&rsquo;s the most collaborative environment I&rsquo;ve ever been a part of. Here, everyone is genuinely invested in each other&rsquo;s success, always ready to extend a helping hand.</li>
<li>I want to express my gratitude to Ron Singler and Aaron Dunbrow for recognizing my passion for the VMware Aria Suite of Products and extending me the opportunity to join the exceptional team at VMware. Being a part of this team as a Senior Cloud Solutions Architect has been an incredibly rewarding journey.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Adding &ldquo;DoNotDelete&rdquo; to a VM Snap Name to control if Auto Deleted.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h6 id="vmware-aria-operations-812-released">VMware Aria Operations 8.12 Released:</h6>
<p>With the release of VMware Aria Operations 8.12, &ldquo;Snapshot Name&rdquo; was added to &ldquo;Delete old snapshots&rdquo;.</p>
<hr>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-01.png" title="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-01.png" data-thumbnail="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-01.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot</h2>">

<h6 id="delete-old-snapshots">Delete old snapshots:</h6>
<p>Adding &ldquo;Snapshot Name&rdquo; to &ldquo;Delete old snapshots&rdquo; in Automation Central may seem like a small change but it adds a lot of Power to the process. This change allows you to create a Job to run everyday that will delete all Snaps on VMs EXCEPT Snaps that have &ldquo;DoNotDelete&rdquo; in the name.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><i class="far fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> You could also do the opposite with this process. You can have the job only delete Snapshots where the Snap Name contains the text &ldquo;AutoDelete&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-03.png" title="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-03.png" data-thumbnail="/unlocking-the-potential-vmware-aria-operations-snap-cleanup/aria-operations-03.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot</figcaption>
    </figure>
<hr>
<p>I prefer using the method to auto delete all old VM snaps, unless you tell me not to. After being a VMware administrator for many years, I have seen to many VMs running with snaps older that 30 days or even with multiple snaps running and each snap 60+ days old. That is NOT best practice. VM Snaps are NOT Backups. Using Automation Central within VMware Aria Operations helps you keep your environment running better and helps you follow some best practice rules.</p>

<h6 id="schedule-report-history-amd-jobs">Schedule, Report, History amd Jobs</h6>
<p>Here are the screens you will see in Automation Central, Schedule, Report, History amd Jobs.</p>
<ul>
<li><i class="far fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Schedule:  Nice calendar view of all scheduled jobs.</li>
<li><i class="far fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Report: Shows you how much storage you were able to re-claim by deleting old snaps.</li>
<li><i class="far fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> History: Shows you every time a Snap was deleted with details.</li>
<li><i class="far fa-check-square fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> Jobs: List of all Jobs you created.</li>
