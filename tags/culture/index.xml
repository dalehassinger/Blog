        <description>&lt;img src="https://vcrocs.info/vmware-the-hvc-community-remains-strong-and-active/featured-image.png" alt="Featured image of post VMware | The HVC Community remains strong and active" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly Successful Event and a very positive customer discussion about VMware Cloud Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On July 12, 2024, the Healthcare Virtualization Community (HVC)&lt;/strong&gt; hosted an in-person event for Healthcare Organizations in and around the Philadelphia Area. Some attendees traveled 2+ hours to attend. The event brought together professionals from various hospitals and medical institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HVC events have been running since 2011, providing a platform for healthcare IT professionals to connect, learn, and share knowledge. I personally started attending in 2013. An easy way to describe the HVC events for people within the VMware vCommunity, itâ€™s like a &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vmug.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VMUG&lt;/a&gt; for Healthcare without any sales pitches and the content is driven by the people attending. Healthcare organizations all have similar rules and requirements with their IT infrastructure, so attending the HVC events have been a great way to learn what other people do, share what you do and build vCommunity relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event was particularly significant as it marked the first in-person gathering after a hiatus caused by COVID-19 restrictions and the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom. With these changes behind us, the VMware Healthcare Teams in the area thought it would be a good time to start up the HVC events again. VMware customers ask for these events to be scheduled. They enjoy attending the events to learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I personally witnessed yesterday at the VMware HVC event, was that the culture that surrounds the VMware Products is alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-are-my-key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Here are my Key Takeaways:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A VMware Healthcare Customer took the time out of their busy schedule to tell their story and journey with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-foundation.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VCF&lt;/a&gt;, that started in 2021. The good and the bad were discussed. I can honestly say that the customers pointed out that there was more positive than negative. One example was upgrades and patching. Far less time spent doing these activities. Engineers spend more time doing Engineering work. Upgrades and patching become more of a monitoring activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone was shaking hands, hugs, laughing,  and just catching up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attendees engaged in lively discussions, networking, and sharing project updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food and drink provided was awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The event had zero negativity, reflecting a strong sense of community among the attendees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-highlights&#34;&gt;Personal Highlights:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was able to meet a co-worker that I have known for almost 5 years, in person. &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.brockpeterson.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Brock Peterson&lt;/a&gt; and I are both VCF &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Aria&lt;/a&gt; Specialists. We help VMware Healthcare and Life Sciences customers with &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.vmware.com/products/aria.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Automation, Monitoring and Logging&lt;/a&gt;. Brock has been a Role Model/Mentor of mine and it was nice to personally say thanks for all the help he has provided these past couple of years and being a valuable resource for me. If you use the VMware product Aria Operations (vROPS), I can guarantee you have read at least one of the awesome &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.brockpeterson.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; that he has written about the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The event&amp;rsquo;s organizers, &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-roberts-1a418724/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Marcus Roberts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan0thom/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Dan Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, deserve special recognition for their hard work in making the event a success. Marcus provided a good conversation at the beginning of the event to give everyone updates and Dan had great fireside chat with the customer discussing their VCF journey, see pic below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <guid>https://vcrocs.info/what-have-i-been-up-to-2nd-half-2022/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://vcrocs.info/what-have-i-been-up-to-2nd-half-2022/featured-image.png" alt="Featured image of post What have I been up to? | 2nd half 2022" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Job | August 2022 | Technical Account Manager (TAM)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 1, 2022 I became an employee of &lt;strong&gt;VMware&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;Technical Account Manager, TAM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hired to be a TAM with a focus on the &lt;strong&gt;vRealize Suite&lt;/strong&gt;. Within a month of my hire date VMware announced &lt;strong&gt;VMware Aria&lt;/strong&gt;. So now I am a TAM with a focus on the VMware Aria Product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work for VMware was a career goal of mine. I was always impressed by the VMware employees that I worked with the past 10+ years. Everyone was always very professional and had a great attitude to help their customers. I wanted to know personally what it was like to work in that type of culture. If you know me you know that I have a passion for the VMware Aria suite of Products. So to be a TAM with a focus on Aria is a good fit for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several months at VMware, this is what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;culture&lt;/strong&gt; overall is very positive. A lot of people helped me in my on-boarding and wanted to see me be successful. People that I knew before I joined VMware reached out to me and said &amp;ldquo;What can I do to help you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The employee &lt;strong&gt;benefits&lt;/strong&gt; are the best that I ever had in my career so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get to do a lot of &lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; to keep your skills up to date and at a level the customers expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The on-boarding process can take days, weeks, months&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get started I received a laptop of my choice 3 days before my start date. Never experienced that before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a &lt;strong&gt;Mentor&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;VMware&lt;/strong&gt; is very important. Someone that wants to help you be successful and will take the time to show you how to do your job, recommend training, help you pick benefits, let you know about different programs to get involved with, let you know about weekly zoom training sessions, help you get a lab setup, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware wants all employees to &lt;strong&gt;give back&lt;/strong&gt; by making donations to non-profits, 100% match by VMware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VMware wants all employees to &lt;strong&gt;donate&lt;/strong&gt; time to non-profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special thanks&lt;/strong&gt; to some people that went above and beyond when I started at VMware to help me, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall Cline, Ariel Sanchez, Brock Peterson, Cosmin Trif, Christopher Kusek, Anton Wesztergom, Alex Musicante, Chad Thomas, David Kruse, Steve Lieberson, Paul Schlosser, Christina Griffus and some I may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am getting more engaged with the customers that I will be working with, I plan to start blogging more again to continue giving back to the vCommunity. Share the knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone that reads my blogs would ever want to talk to me about being a VMware employee, please reach out to me. I will share my experience 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another area that I want to give back to the vCommunity is to help Mentor others. If anyone wants to ever talk, please reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
