<hr>
<hr>
<p>vRealize Operations does a good job to show you what the correct number for vCPU/Memory settings should be based on monitoring history. But instead of showing APP owners a screen that just shows what the current VM vCPU/Memory settings are and what the new settings &ldquo;Should&rdquo; be, I wanted to show the real data that proves why these changes should be made. It can still be hard for people to understand that taking away a VM resources can make performance better.  If a mechanic told you to replace a v-8 engine in a vehicle with a 4 cylinder to get more performance, would you believe them? Probably not!</p>
<p>vROPS Right Sizing does not just show you what vCPU to remove to make a VM performance better.  If a VM requires more vCPU resources there is a Metric CPU|Add that can be very useful.</p>

<p>In vCenter if you look at the performance of a VM one of the options is to show CPU Ready|State (ms). I think this is a metric that you can show to an APP Owner and they can understand why this is important.</p>

<p>When I looked at vROPS OOTB (Out of the Box) the VM CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) was not being collected. I wanted to be able to show the CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) in a Right-Size/Performance Dashboard to show APP Owners this value.</p>

Here is a vROPS Dashboard that I created to show APP Owners Performance information and Right Sizing information in a "Single Pane of Glass". A question the APP Owners always ask is WHY should we take resources away from a VM to make the performance better. If you look at the Column CPU|Remove and then look at the column CPU|Ready (ms), the CPU|Ready (ms) is much higher on VMs that are <b>NOT</b> Right Sized.  
In one Dashboard I am showing several CPU performance metrics, vSAN performance metrics, CPU configuration (Counts/Hot ADD) and Right Sizing. I like to be able to look at all these metrics at the same time. Nice to be able to see if there is a relationship between performance, latency and Right Sizing. Does CPU performance affect the vSAN performance? Here is a VM that CPU|Remove is 0 and the CPU|Ready (ms) is much lower. Why is that?</div>
<div><br></div>
<p>Dashboard Screen Shot:</p>

<div><b>CPU | Ready (ms) metric after using vROPS Right Size recommendation:</b></div>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-08.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>This metric chart is showing a VM that had 12 CPU.  vROPS recommended that the CPU count be 10.  Before VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 1500 - 2000 (ms).  After the VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 500 - 600 (ms). If you would do this across 100s of VMs in a cluster you would see even more performance gains because then the &ldquo;Noisy Neighbors&rdquo; would not be as Noisy.</p>
<hr>
<div><b>Performance Values:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>CPU|Ready (ms) should be 1000 or less for best performance</li>
<li>CPU|Remove - I like to keep this at 2 or less.  For some applications this can be trial and error.</li>
<li>CPU|Add - I like to keep this at 0. Make sure the VM is sized with enough resources. Don&rsquo;t under size VMs. This will keep the APP Owners Happy!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<div><b>The next section was in an IBM KB article that I found helpful:</b></div>
<p>CPU ready time is a vSphere metric that records the amount of time a VM is ready to use CPU but was unable to schedule physical CPU time because all the vSphere ESXi host CPU resources are busy. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of VMs on the host and their CPU loads. It is normal for a VM to average between 0–50 ms of CPU ready time; anything over 1000 ms is considered to lead to VM performance problems.</p>
<p>VMs that are configured with multiple vCPUs will suffer from an increased amount of ready time than compared to VMs with fewer vCPUs configured. Ready time increases as the VM needs more vCPU resources to be made available at the same time and, therefore, may have to wait for extended times for all the required vCPUS to be free to be made available to the VM with more vCPUs.</p>
<hr>
<div><b>In Addition to Right Sizing</b>, I also think that <b>Optimizing</b> a VM is important. VMware has a Fling available that I like to use <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/vmware-os-optimization-tool?src=vmw_so_vex_pmasz_426" target="_blank">VMware OS Optimization Tool</a>
that helps you optimize CPU Settings.</div>
<hr>
<div><b>Dashboard Tips:</b></div>
<ul>
<li>Add Color to the list data to make poor performance values catch your eye. (I used Red)</li>
<li>Use Donut Charts to show some of the metrics that you feel are more important.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add color to List View values, use Show advanced settings for a metric:</p>
<div><br></div>
<a class="lightgallery" href="images/post/right-size-09.png" title="images/post/right-size-09.png" data-thumbnail="images/post/right-size-09.png">

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>  
<p>Enter the metric values when you want the color to change:</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-10.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>I like using Donut Charts in Dashboards. You can show a lot of data in a small amount of screen space. Using colors also catches your eye quickly when there are issues:</p>
<figure><a class="lightgallery" href="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" title="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" data-thumbnail="/vrealize-operations-right-size/right-size-11.png" data-sub-html="<h2>Click to see Larger Image</h2>">
        
    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<hr>
<p>When I write about Automation I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task.  Monitoring is the same way.  I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization will be different.  Add/Remove columns in the Dashboard to suite you needs. There is no right or wrong way to monitor. Maybe other metrics make more sense to you. What is important with monitoring is don&rsquo;t install vRealize Operation and not use it. Don&rsquo;t make vROPS Shelfware! This is a GREAT Tool that shows you so much information about your virtual environment. And it keeps getting better&hellip;</p>

    <title>Text Display Widget - More Powerful than just displaying text on a Dashboard...</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>vRealize Operations - Dashboards:</strong></p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>I was recently reviewing some sample custom vRealize Operations Dashboards and I seen where some of the Dashboards had custom text and images.  I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget.</p>
<p>The first thought I had was to display the weather for both the data center locations where I work.  This could be used with a NOC type Dashboard.  I looked online for a weather widget site and got the code to display the weather for the specific locations. If you go to Administration/Configuration/Metric Configurations/TxtWidgetContent you can create html files to save the widget code. See examples in images below. You can display any Widget data from any web site that provides widgets using the &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget.</p>
<p>After I successfully added weather widgets I wanted to get more serious and show data from a SQL Database. I use a SQL database to store data from some vRealize Automation Day 2 BluePrints that I created. Some example BluePrints where I store data in a SQL DB are Server Builds and Server Decomissions. I created a web page that displayed the SQL Data and added another “Text Display” widget to the Dashboard.  I used the url of the web page and assigned it to the widget and now I am also able to show SQL Data on a Dashboard.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to show Weather and SQL data is to use vRealize Operations Dashboards as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring. I have never seen a demo from VMware to use the “Text Display” Widget this way but I think this is awesome. This could completely change the way I use vRealize Operations Dashboards. There are not always vRealize Operations Management Packs available and this provides a cool way to show any data on a Dashboard.  The data will be for reference only but it does allow the &ldquo;Single Pane of Glass&rdquo;.</p>

    </a><figcaption class="image-caption">Click to see Larger Image</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>The url web page could be a static or dynamic page. Use whatever works best for you.  I think this opens up so many possibilities of what you can display on a Custom Dashboard. If you want to take it a step further you could publish the Custom vRealize Operations Dashboard with Workspace One and provide the data to anyone in your organization even if they are not a vRealize Operations user.  Cool Shit!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Text Display&rdquo; Widget should be renamed to the &ldquo;Cool Shit&rdquo; Widget!</p>
