      <description>I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this blog as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful.

      <description>vExpert 2020 - 2022          VMware vExpert 2020 - 2022    I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program. This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.</description>
