<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The <strong>VMware Communities Podcast</strong> has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, <strong>Matt Langguth</strong>, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and &ldquo;Little Hacks&rdquo; hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at <strong>VMware Explore 2023</strong>, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a <strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> and talk about the presentation that I did in the <strong>VMware {code} Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a &ldquo;Little Hack&rdquo;, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>
