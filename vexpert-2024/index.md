##### VMware vExpert 2020 - Present

---

I'm immensely honored to be included in the VMware vExpert program once again, marking my fifth year of participation. The aspect of the vExpert program I find particularly commendable is its focus on acknowledging individuals for their contributions and dedication to "Giving Back". Being chosen for the vExpert program signifies a commitment to sharing knowledge and a desire to elevate not just oneself but also those within the vCommunity.  

As an employee of Broadcom By VMware, one of my primary ambitions is to contribute more significantly to the vCommunity than I could as a user of VMware products.

###### What is the VMware vExpert Program?

###### Program Overview

The VMware vExpert program is VMware's global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware's marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware's roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year's (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.
 
###### Criteria



If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term "giving back" is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.
