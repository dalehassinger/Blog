###### VMware Aria Automation Config API:

I used VMware Aria Automation Config 8.14 to create this Blog Post. When new versions of VMware Aria Automation Config are released, the code may need to be changed.  

There is a lot of Automation that I like to complete where I use the VMware Aria Automation Config API. The code that I am sharing can be used as a PowerShell Script, VMware Aria Automation ABX Action, VMware Aria Automation Orchestrator Action or VMware Aria Automation Orchestrator Workflow.  

All of my customers are 80% - 90% Microsoft Windows Servers. That is why you will see a lot of PowerShell code as examples in my Blog Posts. I like to share what my customers will find useful.   

All the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Please click on the link to see the code.

When I write my blogs, I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. This article is just one way that you could accomplish this task. I am showing what I felt was a good way to complete the use case but every organization/environment will be different. There is no right or wrong way to complete the tasks in this article.
