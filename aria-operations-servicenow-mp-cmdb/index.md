###### VMware Aria Operations  

VMware Aria Operations 8.14.1 and Servicenow MP (Management Pack) 9.0 was used for this Blog Post. When new versions of VMware Aria Operations or the MP are released, the code or process may need to be changed.  

All the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code.

I wanted to share how I setup the Servicenow Management Pack in my lab to update a Servicenow CMDB. The VMware Documentation covers the process well. I wanted to cover a couple of steps to help make the process easier.  

---

I followed the instructions exactly as listed in the PDF link below.  

[Instructions to setup Servicenow to allow the MP to send data to CMDB | Click Here to View PDF](servicenow-cmdb-sync-only-configuration.pdf)  


For the Servicenow user permissions I did the following:  
* Created a Servicenow user named LPU (Least Privilege User)  
* Created a Servicenow Role and named it vROPS_MP  
* Added the user to the role.  
* Added the role to all the Servicenow ACLs listed in the document. If there were more than one ACL with the same name with read permissions, I used the newest ACL. I did not add to all ACLs with the same name.  
* I gave the role “read” and “edit_ci_relations” to the tables listed in the document.  
* I used the moid_populate_only.json config that is OOTB (Out of the Box) with no changes to start to make sure everything was working correct.  

When I added the account to the management pack in Aria Operations it did a good job to let me know if everything was set up correctly in Servicenow. I had a permission wrong and it showed me what was wrong when I did a Validate Connection. I fixed the permission like it showed me and then everything worked. My lab data is now showing up in Servicenow CMDB.

OOTB, the config files can be found here on the VMware Aria Operations Appliance:  
The config file will go here: /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/user/plugins/inbound/servicenow_adapter3/work  
The templates are located at: /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/user/plugins/inbound/servicenow_adapter3/conf/config_samples

Here is the moid_populate_only.json with no changes.

{
  "cmdbSync": {
    "syncMode": "POPULATE_ONLY",
    "objectIdentifierSource": "MOID"
  }
}
{{< /highlight >}}  

---

After I verified everything was working with OOTB settings, I wanted to add some additional data to the Servicenow CMDB. The VM (virtual machine) IP address is not sent to Servicenow CMDB with default settings. Here is the json file I have in my lab to  send VM IP and Host CPU info.

{{< highlight json >}}  
{
  "cmdbSync": {
    "syncMode": "POPULATE_ONLY",
    "objectIdentifierSource": "MOID",

      "builtInHostSystem": [
        {
          "cmdbColumn": "cpu_name",
          "vropsType": "PROPERTY",
          "vropsField": "cpu|cpuModel"
        }
      ]
        ,
        "builtInVirtualMachine": [
          {
            "cmdbColumn": "guest_os_fullname",
            "vropsType": "PROPERTY",
            "vropsField": "summary|guest|fullName"
          },
          {
            "cmdbColumn": "ip_address",
            "vropsType": "PROPERTY",
            "vropsField": "summary|guest|ipAddress"
          }
        ]
    }
  }
}

In the VMware documentation it says to use the vropsField name in the json config file but I did not see where it told you how to get the vropsField name. Here are some examples on how to get the vROPS field names.

Here is the results of running the PowerShell scripts to get the vropsField names. The column "name" is what you need to use in the json config file.

If you don't want to use the PowerSHell Scripts to get the VMware Aria Operations field names, watch this YouTube video to see the steps I used to get the field names using the VMware Aria Operations APIs.

The cmdbColumn name info that needs included in the json config file is in Servicenow. Watch this YouTube video to see the steps I used to get the Servicenow column names to use with the json config file.
