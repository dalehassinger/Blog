All the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code. VMware Aria Automation Orchestrator Actions are a very powerful way to add checks into your server build process. This Blog Post shows you how to verify that the AD OU structure is in place before you do a new Server Build. Within the VMware Aria Automation Catalog, you can have custom forms to ask all the questions required to build a new server (see screen shot). One of the questions can be which AD OU you want to create the new Windows Server. The list of existing OUs in AD can be a dropdown with all the AD OU names provided by a Action. After you select the OU name to locate the new Windows Server Build, the next Action can verify that all the AD Sub OUs are in place. If the OUs are in place the action will only verify. If an AD OU is missing, the Action will create the AD OU before you press submit to create new Server. Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Watch this video to see the complete process that is discussed in this Blog Post.

Instructions to setup Servicenow to allow the MP to send data to CMDB | Click Here to View PDF For the Servicenow user permissions I did the following: Created a Servicenow user named LPU (Least Privilege User) Created a Servicenow Role and named it vROPS_MP Added the user to the role. Added the role to all the Servicenow ACLs listed in the document. If there were more than one ACL with the same name with read permissions, I used the newest ACL. I did not add to all ACLs with the same name. I gave the role “read” and “edit_ci_relations” to the tables listed in the document. I used the moid_populate_only.json config that is OOTB (Out of the Box) with no changes to start to make sure everything was working correct. When I added the account to the management pack in Aria Operations, it did a good job to let me know if everything was set up correctly in Servicenow and if the json config file was setup correct.

When new versions of VMware Aria Automation are released, the code may need to be changed. All the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code. I wanted to share how I use Action Constants and Secrets within VMware Aria Automation. Action Constants are a great to have a variable that can be used with many Actions where the value may change. Instead of having to edit 10s or 100s of Actions, you change One Action Constant and all the Actions are updated instantly. Main reason to use Secrets is to keep the values of Passwords out of the code! Plus, like Action Constants, if a Password would change, all you need to do is change one Secret and all your Actions and Templates are automatically Updated. Secrets can also be used in the yaml code of Templates. Action Constants Action Constants Use Cases: vCenter Username vCenter FQDN VMware Aria Automation Config Username VMware Aria Automation Config FQDN salt master FQDN Any value used in Actions that may change from time to time To access Action Constants: Assembler/Extensibility/Actions/Actions Constants You will see the Action Constants Names and Values. Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot How to use Action Constants and Secrets with an Action: Add the Action Constants and Secrets used within the Action in the Default inputs section. To use a Action Constant value within the Action PowerShell code use $inputs.“Action Constant” To use a Secret value within the Action PowerShell code use $context.getSecret($inputs.“Secret Name”) In the example code, review how I am connecting to the vCenter. No hard coded Username, Password or vCenter FQDN. If any of these values would change, I would never need to edit the Action, only the Action Constants and Secret.

New VMware Aria Operations for Logs updates are released every month, so the details shown in this Blog Post could change. When you use VMware Aria Operations for Logs | SaaS Version, you need to have one or more Cloud Proxies to send the log info from your on-prem vCenter and ESXi Hosts to VMware Cloud Services. If you have more than (1) Cloud Proxy, there is no automated way built into VMware Aria Operations for Logs to distribute the Cloud Proxy usage. One way to set the vCenter ESXi hosts to use a specific Cloud Proxy, is to use a PowerCLI script. I included some sample scripts in this blog post to help you get started. Logic of the PowerCLI script: The script will count the number of VMware Cloud Services, Cloud Proxies Specified The script will count the number of VMware vCenter ESXi Hosts in the vCenter Specified The script will equally distribute the number of vCenter ESXi Hosts per Cloud Proxy The script will set the Advanced System Setting “Syslog.global.logHost” on each ESXi Host ESXi Host Advanced System Settings: This is how to manually set the “Syslog.global.logHost” on each ESXi Host Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Cloud Proxies: Go to Configuration/Cloud Proxies to see all the Proxies added Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Cloud Proxy Information: Cloud Proxy Details like State, CPU, Memory Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot vSphere Integration: Go to Configuration/vSphere Integration to see all the vCenters added Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot vCenter Server Configuration: vCenter Server Configuration You can use this screen to set which Cloud Proxy to use but if you have 100s or 1000s of Hosts, I find it easier to use the script included in this Blog Post.

When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at VMware Explore 2023, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a Hackathon Team Captain and talk about the presentation that I did in the VMware {code} Theater. Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a “Little Hack”, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career. Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.

So many people helped me get to where I am in my career and it was good for me to personally thank them. I was the Team Captain of a Hackathon Team that won 2nd place. The Hackathon Team was a great group of people that I will now call my friends for the rest of my life. During the Hackathon I did 1:1 presentations to Alan Renouf, Chris Wolf and other great Hackathon Judges. While doing the 1:1 to Alan, William Lam was also at my table to discuss the Teams project. Hackathon Team: Tina Krogull Wes Milliron Viviana Miranda Madison Welsch Edgar Sanchez Dale Hassinger I did my first live presentation in the VMware {code} Theater. The session was full with friends, co-workers, customers and other conference attendees. The feedback after my presentation was great with many people wanting more information and follow-ups. The topic was of interest to a lot of people. There were many sessions with new VMware product announcements that are very exciting. Go view the recorded session videos on the VMware Explore Web Site. Attending VMware Explore as an employee for the first time was a much different experience than when I was customer.

VMware Aria Operations 8.12 Released: With the release of VMware Aria Operations 8.12, “Snapshot Name” was added to “Delete old snapshots”. Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Delete old snapshots: Adding “Snapshot Name” to “Delete old snapshots” in Automation Central may seem like a small change but it adds a lot of Power to the process. This change allows you to create a Job to run everyday that will delete all Snaps on VMs EXCEPT Snaps that have “DoNotDelete” in the name. You could also do the opposite with this process. You can have the job only delete Snapshots where the Snap Name contains the text “AutoDelete”. Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot I prefer using the method to auto delete all old VM snaps, unless you tell me not to. After being a VMware administrator for many years, I have seen to many VMs running with snaps older that 30 days or even with multiple snaps running and each snap 60+ days old. That is NOT best practice. VM Snaps are NOT Backups. Using Automation Central within VMware Aria Operations helps you keep your environment running better and helps you follow some best practice rules. Schedule, Report, History amd Jobs Here are the screens you will see in Automation Central, Schedule, Report, History amd Jobs. Schedule: Nice calendar view of all scheduled jobs. Report: Shows you how much storage you were able to re-claim by deleting old snaps. History: Shows you every time a Snap was deleted with details. Jobs: List of all Jobs you created.

VMware Aria Operations 8.12 Released: With the release of VMware Aria Operations 8.12, Metric Searches was added to the product. Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot I always like to create Dashboards with VMware Aria Operations to show metric information that I think is important to a VMware Admin. I think that metric searches will help provide a lot of information that is not included on existing or custom dashboards. Metric Searches will also allow non-admins, that don’t have permission to create dashboards and views, to see specific information to help troubleshoot an issue. I really like how the results of a metric search will stack and then you can scroll to see what item has the highest value. You can change the results to show different time ranges. After results are displayed you can also start defining the parents of the results. Search Examples: In this example the metric search found all VMs with CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms. When search is complete you can define the search further by selecting the parent host. # --- Find All VMs with CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms Metric: Virtual Machine where CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Now lets take the search used above and define the results further by specifying host or cluster. # --- Find All VMs with CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms WHERE the host is esx-02a.corp.local Metric: Virtual Machine where CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms childOf esx-02a.corp.local # --- Find All VMs with CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms WHERE the cluster is Cluster-01 Metric: Virtual Machine where CPU|Ready ms \u003e 750 ms childOf Cluster-01 Example Metric Searches for VMs: # --- Find All VMs with CPU usage % greater than 90 Metric: Virtual Machine where CPU|Usage % \u003e 90 # --- Find All VMs with Memory usage % greater than 90 Metric: Virtual Machine where Memory|Usage % \u003e 90 # --- Find All VMs with Snap Shots older than 2 days Metric: Virtual Machine where {Disk Space|Snapshot|Age (Days)} \u003e 2 # --- Find All VMs running longer than 30 days.

I know a lot of VMware admins that use RVTools on a regular basis. RVTools was #1 on the VMware Tools list on vSpeaking Podcast Episode 108. When I was a VMware Customer, I used RVTools for 10+ years. Recently I was asked how to see some of the data that RVTools generates in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. Some of the data displayed in the RVTools vHealth Worksheet is not a metric or property that VMware Aria Operations collects or generates. The company uses VMware Aria Operations for all monitoring and thought it would be nice to see this additional data in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. They would auto generate the RVTools files everyday, but it was additional steps to open the generated spreadsheet file, plus they had to remember to go look at the RVTools data. If the RVTools data was in a Dashboard, they thought it would be easier to see and wouldn’t have to remember to go look at the data. They would make the RVTools Dashboard a favorite in VMware Aria Operations and look at the data everyday. If you don’t use RVTools today, take some time and review it. There are some good use cases for using the product. Awesome to see a Product developed by a VMware admin to make his life easier, and then shared and used by over a million people within the vCommunity. Use Case Customer used RVTools to see data about their VMware environment. Customer used VMware Aria Operations for all monitoring. Customer wanted to have a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard that showed RVTools data to create a “Single Pane of Glass” experience. Steps to complete the process: Automate the process to generate the RVTools xlsx file everyday. Generate html files from the RVTools xlsx file, to display in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. Need access to a Web Server of your choice to save the html files. The files are static, so any flavor of web server will work. RVTools vHealth data in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard: Screen shot of Dashboard Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot PowerShell Script: The script was created to be dynamic. No worksheet names or field names are hard coded. If new Worksheets or fields are added to RVTools in the future, they will automatically be picked up with this script. RVTools provides a program to encrypt your password that will be used with the script. The program is named “RVToolsPasswordEncryption.exe”. The PowerShell Script uses the importexcel PowerShell Module to see the data in the RVTools xlsx file. If you have never used the importexcel module, please review to see if you would have other use cases. No need to have Excel Installed. Works Awesome, one of my Favorite PowerShell Modules.

This scenario is common across the VMware stack of products as it’s not practical to have a button for everything, but it usually leads to the follow up question in some form of “well how do I call that?”. I wanted to write about a recent experience with a colleague as a means of showing one way to accomplish that. Before I jump into the details, I wanted to add somewhat of a disclaimer that with any type of automation there are numerous ways to solve a particular problem. Based on my comfort with specific products and scripting languages, what’s below is how I was able to work with the client to address the problem. There is the possibility that another person could accomplish the same task in a different way and none of it is ‘wrong’. A colleague came to me and asked about a way to assist a client looking to add several networks into a Network Profile within Cloud Assembly (a component of Aria Automation). While his client could have very easily clicked one-by-one in the UI, that is a tedious operation and runs the risk of human error. Based on the client’s familiarity with PowerShell, we opted to write a script to invoke the necessary API’s using the Invoke-RestMethod PowerShell cmdlet. So, to frame up a bit more of the ‘how’, when faced with a scenario like this, we need to have a script that performs three steps: Steps: Get your authentication token/header configured Find the appropriate URI and use a ‘GET’ method to look at the formatting and to help build a body Find the appropriate URI and method (e.g. ‘PATCH’ or ‘POST’) in order to call that API and feed it the necessary information in the body Step 1: So, I need to provide a set of credentials to the CSP login URI. This will give me a refresh token which I can then feed to the IaaS login URI to get my access token. The access token will be what I can use to make the necessary calls into my Aria Automation environment. The URI’s and some more detail are provided in VMware KB 89129. There are some potentially easier methods to authenticate to Aria Automation and invoke a REST API call (like the PowerVRA Module), but for my example below, I used all native PowerShell. #BasicInfo: $vraServer = \"vra.corp.local\" #Get Credentials to build auth: $credential = Get-Credential $username = $credential.UserName $pass = $credential.Password $password = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($pass)) $authBody = @{ \"username\" = $username \"password\" = $password } #Build Header: $header = New-Object \"System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]\" $header.Add(\"Accept\",\"application/json\") $header.Add(\"Content-Type\",\"application/json\") #Get Refresh Token: $uri = \"https://\" + $vraServer + \"/csp/gateway/am/api/login?access_token\" $refreshToken = Invoke-RestMethod -uri $uri -Method POST -Headers $header -Body ($authBody | ConvertTo-Json) -SkipCertificateCheck $refreshToken = $refreshToken.refresh_token $refreshTokenBody = @{ \"refreshToken\" = $refreshToken } #Get Access Token: $uri = \"https://\" + $vraServer + \"/iaas/api/login\" $accessToken = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method POST -Headers $header -body ($refreshTokenBody | ConvertTo-JSON) -SkipCertificateCheck $accessToken = \"Bearer \" + $accessToken.token #add access token to Header $header.Add(\"Authorization\",$accessToken) Step 2: Now that I have the $accessToken variable set and added to my header, I can make any REST API calls I need. For this example, we wanted to add a bunch of fabric-networks (in vSphere parlance DvPGs) to a network profile. In VMware Aria Automation, these are already available with the addition of my vCenter Cloud Account, just not associated with a network profile.

VMware has a PowerShell Module, PowerCLI, that I use with almost all automation that I create. With VMware Aria Automation, you can use PowerShell with Workflows, Actions, and have salt execute PowerShell scripts with state files and functions. So I reached out to the hosts of “The PowerShell Podcast” and showed my interest to be a guest on the Podcast. They thought that my story would make a good episode, so we scheduled a time to record. The experience to record the podcast episode was great. The behind the scenes was funny. The guests talk to each other the same way they do when when recording an episode. They make you feel comfortable as a guest. Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information. The episode I recorded with “The PowerShell Podcast” was released on 03/20/2023.

I want to create new Windows Servers in VMware Aria Automation that will be production ready when the server build process is complete. One item when building new Windows Servers is adding drives. I want a way to add additional drives and have the drive be online and formatted properly. Non SQL Windows Servers will have data drives formatted with 4k allocation unit size and Windows SQL Servers will have the data drives formatted with 64k allocation unit size. VMware Aria Automation provides a way to add drives OOTB (Out of the Box) but does not automatically format the drives. That is why I use a Salt state in my example. I use the salt state to bring the new drive online and format. This Blog post shows one way to accomplish these tasks. I always say, with automation there a 100 ways to do the same process. Hopefully this Blog gives you some ideas and options. Use Case Add Cloud Agnostic Volumes to a VMware Aria Automation Cloud Template. To make New Windows Server Builds consistent I show the drives that are available on the Catalog Item Custom Form. You don’t need to add any additional drives. Keep the drive sizes at the default size of “0” and the drives DO NOT get created. At the end of the new server build I want the new Windows Server drives to be online and formatted properly. Be production ready! Steps to complete the process: Automated Salt minion installation. See the Blog Post I wrote that completes this step. Click Here Add grains data about the drives to minion when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. Run a state file when the minion installation completes that brings the new drive online and formats the drive so that it is ready to use immediately. See example yaml code. Requirements: This blog was created using VMware Aria Automation and VMware Aria Automation Config version 8.11.0 (Salt version 3005.1). The process may vary for different versions of VMware Aria Automation and Salt. Cloud Template | Windows 2019 Server: There are (3) Cloud Agnostic Volumes on the Cloud Template for my use case.

This is the fourth year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and “Giving Back”. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter. One of my goals as an VMware employee is to be able to give more back to the vCommunity than I was able to as an end user of the VMware Products. 2023 is also the 3rd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram. What is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware’s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware’s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware’s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year’s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for. Criteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term “giving back” is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.

Use Case VMware Aria Automation Config has been the Configuration Management tool that I like to use with Servers, Windows and Linux. The first process to use salt with new servers is to install the salt minion, which is an agent that needs installed on the Server. There are many different ways to install the salt minion agent and what I wanted to show in this blog post is how to use the SaltStack Config Resource with the VMware Automation Cloud Template. When creating a Cloud Template in VMware Aria Automation, one of the options is to add the SaltStack Config Resource. What the SaltStack Config Resource provides: Automated Salt minion installation Ability to add grains data to minion when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. The minion key is auto-accepted in SaltStack Config If you delete the VM deployment in VMware Aria Automation, the minion key will be automatically removed from VMware Aria Automation Config. Built-in decommission. Ability to run a state file when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. Requirements: This blog was created using VMware Aria Automation version 8.11.0. The process may vary for different version of VMware Aria Automation. TCP Port 445 needs to be open between VMware Aria Automation Config server and the new Server that the minion is being installed on. Check the VMware Aria Automation Config server. The OS that you are using for the new server must have an agent file in the /etc/salt/cloud.deploy.d folder. Check the VMware Aria Automation Config server. The version of the agent files in the /etc/salt/cloud.deploy.d folder must match the version of the salt master. The script that creates the grains file when using the SaltStack Config Resource and VMware Aria cloud templates with Windows Servers needs to be manually replaced on the VMware Aria Automation Config Server (salt master). Future VMware Aria Automation Config installs with LCM (VMware Aria Suite LifeCycle) will include this fix. The script creates the grains file in the incorrect folder. Location of script on salt master: /lib64/python3.7/site-packages/salt/utils/cloud.py Make a copy of the original cloud.py before replacing with updated version. Where to get new script: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/utils/cloud.py The grains file will be created in “C:\\ProgramData\\Salt Project\\Salt\\conf” after the script is updated. Update: When I installed VMware Aria Automation Config 8.12, 8.13 and 8.14 I still needed to update the cloud.py file for the grains to be created properly. Current OS support: Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot Any OS not listed is currently not supported at this time.

A question was recently asked, How can we specify and maintain which DataStore Cluster a VM should use within the VMware vCenter UI? I like using vCenter TAGs for specifying details about VMs, so I thought I would use VMware vCenter TAGs to specify which DataStore Cluster to place a VM. I looked at using a Configuration management tool like salt but one of the requirements was to make it easy for the VMware Admin to specify and maintain VM DataStore placement within the VMware vCenter UI. I have included sample code that will: Create a VMware vCenter TAG Category Create a VMware vCenter TAG based on DataStore Cluster Name Add the DataStore Cluster VMware vCenter TAG to all VMs within a DataStore cluster Verify that each VM has only (1) vCenter DataStore Cluster TAG Verify that the VM is in the correct DataStore Cluster. Do a VM move if it is not in correct DataStore Cluster. Use Case: Have a way to specify which DataStore Cluster the VM will use within VMware vCenter UI. Have a process in place that will maintain which DataStore Cluster will be used with each VM within VMware vCenter. If a user moves a VM to a DataStore Cluster that it shouldn’t be located, move it back to the correct Datastore Cluster to match the assigned VMware vCenter TAG. Solution: Create a VMware vCenter TAG for every DataStore Cluster within VMware vCenter. Assign a VMware vCenter TAG to every VM within vCenter, to specify which DataStore Cluster it should be located. Schedule a VMware Aria Automation Orchestrator Workflow to run everyday to make sure VM DataStore Cluster placement matches VMware vCenter TAG assigned.

Use Case I was recently asked how the VMware Aria Automation | Ansible Integration worked. I never used Ansible before so I thought this would be great time to learn Ansible and demo the integration with VMware Aria Automation. If you look at some of my previous blog posts I wrote about SaltStack Config a lot. I thought this would be a good time for myself to learn Ansible and compare the two products. When I started reading about the VMware Aria Automation and Ansible Integration, I didn’t find a single blog post or article that covered everything from installing Ansible to creating a new Server Build in Aria Automation. I am going to document all the steps that it took for me to do a complete Aria Automation | Ansible integration. I hope that someone will find this blog post useful on their Automation journey. A lot of people that write about Ansible use it with Red Hat Linux. For my demo environment, I chose to use Rocky Linux so that I don’t need to worry about any Red Hat licenses. Some people online recommend using Rocky Linux to replace CentOS. Sometimes it seems that the version of Linux you choose and what product to you use for Automation and Config management can be almost a religious debate. This blog post is to cover a specific use case. How to use VMware Aria Automation | Ansible Integration. Use whatever version of Linux you want. The details that I write about may need to be modified slightly if you use a different version of Linux. This blog post will at least give you the framework to get started.

To work for VMware was a career goal of mine. I was always impressed by the VMware employees that I worked with the past 10+ years. Everyone was always very professional and had a great attitude to help their customers. I wanted to know personally what it was like to work in that type of culture. If you know me you know that I have a passion for the VMware Aria suite of Products. So to be a TAM with a focus on Aria is a good fit for me. After several months at VMware, this is what I learned. The culture overall is very positive. A lot of people helped me in my on-boarding and wanted to see me be successful. People that I knew before I joined VMware reached out to me and said “What can I do to help you”. The employee benefits are the best that I ever had in my career so far. You get to do a lot of training to keep your skills up to date and at a level the customers expect. The on-boarding process can take days, weeks, months… To get started I received a laptop of my choice 3 days before my start date. Never experienced that before. Having a Mentor at VMware is very important. Someone that wants to help you be successful and will take the time to show you how to do your job, recommend training, help you pick benefits, let you know about different programs to get involved with, let you know about weekly zoom training sessions, help you get a lab setup, etc… VMware wants all employees to give back by making donations to non-profits, 100% match by VMware.

As a Windows Admin most of my automation was done with PowerShell. All the examples you see in the salt documentation are written in Python, so to use Python for some processes makes sense. I had a use case that made sense to use Python. I want to schedule reboots of AWS EC2 instances using SaltStack Config. For Servers that are on-prem I would always automate the process to create a server reboot scheduled task in vCenter. With AWS I want to use VMware SaltStack Config to schedule the Server Reboot. Manual Steps: Create a SaltStack Config Job to do the reboot. I create a job named “vRA | Server Reboot”. This job will be used for all scheduled server reboots. Copy the Python Code below and create a ScheduleServerReboot.py file that will be copied to the SSC server. The Python Code completes the following steps: Creates a Target that uses the grain “id” and will only target the Server that you want to reboot. Creates a Run Once Schedule to use the job and new target that was created. Sends an email to show that the run once schedule to reboot server was created.

After a quick test in my lab I had the same issue with the newest version of SaltStack Config. DO NOT use this blog post until I get a working version in my lab. If you want to work with the VMware Aria Automation Config API please use this newer Blog Post that I created: Unlocking the Potential | VMware Aria Automation Config API This post is to show how to use PowerShell to make RESTful API calls to SaltStack Config. This is something that I have wanted to do for awhile. I could never find any examples in my Google searches, so I took the time to learn how the examples that use curl work and translated that into PowerShell Code. I hope some Windows Server Admins will find this post helpful. I like using salt to do Windows Server Configuration Management more than remote PowerShell. You can run changes against many servers at the exact same time instead of looping thru a list of servers names. I am also going to look at use salt-api with vRealize Automation ABX action scripts. In some previous posts I used the POSH-SSH module but when you use the salt-api, the PowerShell Module POSH-SSH is no longer needed.

This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and “Giving Back”. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter. 2022 is also the 2nd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram. I think that 2021 was one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.

I did a VMware Customer Reference Interview that will be released in 2022. Link to Customer Reference I shared a vRealize Operations “Right Sizing” Dashboard on the code.vmware.com web site. What is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware’s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware’s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware’s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year’s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for. Criteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term “giving back” is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.

Windows Server grain data not available out of the of box that I want to add to every minion AND make sure the grain data stays up to date: Windows Server Features | Roles Windows Server Installed Software Windows Server Running Services These are the steps that I use to maintain custom grain data with a Windows Server: Create a PowerShell Script that can run locally on a minion. Add the script to the SaltStack Config File Manager. Use salt-call to run salt.functions locally on a minion. See screen shot and my code examples below. Create a SaltStack Config Job to execute the PowerShell Script remotely on the minion. See Screen Shot. Create a SaltStack Config Schedule to run the job that you create. The job can run every day, once a week, every 4 hours. Whatever makes sense for your use case. See Screen Shot. If you want to run a script locally on a minion and use salt functions that is where you use the salt-call command. After you learn the salt-functions and are logged into a Windows Server locally, you can still use salt commands by using salt-call. # --- example code salt-call --version salt-call test.ping # --- Show Disk Usage salt-call disk.usage # --- Show Installed Features|Roles salt-call win_servermanager.list_installed # --- Show Installed Sofwtare salt-call pkg.list_pkgs Link to salt-call Documentation Step 1 - Add script to SaltStack Config File Manager: See code examples below to add Windows Server Features|Roles, Installed Software, and Runnings Services as grain data.

I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash. In 2021, I started living the “Salt Life”. In July, I installed SaltStack Config for the first time and started taking a serious look at Salt. I went from zero to doing a presentation about SaltStack at VMworld 2021 in October and another presentation at SaltConf21 in November. Having a session selected for VMworld 2021 was a career “Bucket List” for me. After creating a vRealize Operations Dashboard on “Right Sizing” that I use in production, my vRealize Account Executive setup a meeting for me to meet Iwan ’e1’ Rahabok, who is the co-creator of the book “Operationalize Your World”. Iwan liked the Dashboard I created and included some details about the Dashboard in his book “Operationalize Your World”. I always say if one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful. In 2021, between the presentations and blogs posts, I feel I have given back and helped some people.

I use PowerShell for a lot of Automation, Windows Server and Linux Server. When working with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config I constantly found myself going to the CLI to test and learn how the salt functions work. In the Part 5 Blog of this series I showed how I am using the PowerShell module POSH-SSH to connect to the VMware vRealize SaltStack Config Server to run salt commands remotely. So I started writing some PowerShell functions to run remote salt commands on the Salt Master. The end goal might be to turn this script into a Salt PowerShell Module. To start it will only have the functions that I find myself using the most. I could turn this into a community Github Project and see if there would be any interest. If anyone reading this blog post has any interest please reach out to me. (Dale.Hassinger@vCROCS.info) My goal is to make all these PowerShell Salt functions work with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config like PowerCLI works with VMware vCenter. Use same verb/noun terminology. I use PowerCLI for all my VMware Automation. Works awesome! So to create these PowerShell Functions to work with my existing automation scripts is a win win in my book. Normally I will use a Products APIs to do all these types of processes. I looked at VMware vRealize SaltStack Config APIs and to the best of my knowledge I can not use them like I can the PS functions that I created. That may change in a future release of VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. Fingers crossed.

I have been spending more time with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config and I have learned some better ways to do some of the processes that I have talked about already. My goal to to learn and use the built-in functions that are already in the product. I found that using the salt functions require less coding and better logging. First example of changing how I am going to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. When I first started looking at grains I thought I would edit the grains file with PowerShell and add the grains content to the file. What I did worked but I think I learned a better way. There is a function grains.append that will append grains data to the grains file on the minion. This works much better and when I run a job to add grains information it is listed in Activity Completed within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. I like to be able to see when changes are made by the jobs that are run. The code that I have listed below to get vCenter TAGs assigned to a VM and add the information to the minion is using PowerShell. To use this script you MUST install the PowerShell Module POSH-SSH. The process I am showing connects to a vCenter, creates a SSH Connection to the Salt Server, gets all assigned vCenter TAGs for a VM, , runs salt commands to add grain information to the grains file of a minion, and then runs a minion grains sync. This concept can be used for a lot of different systems. If you want to add NSX-T Security TAGs as grain information (Thanks Karl Hauck for this idea), AD (Active Directory) OU of the Windows Server, or anything you think would be useful to Target minions within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. I really like the idea of using POSH-SSH to make the SSH connection to the Salt Master Server and running commands. I do a lot of Automation within vRA (vRealize Automation) with PowerShell and I can use this same concept to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config to complete the processes that need run. I can also create Catalog items within vRA that you can make available to APP Teams to use. The Catalog item could be running salt jobs in VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. Cool Stuff! Grains File: This is what I learned about salt grains when using with a Windows OS. The default location of the grains file is in directory “C:\\salt\\conf\". The grains file is named grains with no extension. Example grains file: NSXSecurityTAGs: - vCROCS.Apps.VMware.SaltStack.Minion vCenterTAGs: - TAG-VM-WebServer - TAG-VM-vCROCS - TAG-App-Hugo “Grain Name”: “The value of the grain”. In my example I wanted the grain to be named “vCenterTags” and the values will be the vCenter TAG names “TAG-VM-vCROCS, TAG-VM-WebServer, TAG-App-Hugo”. I have (3) vCenter TAGs assigned to this VM. I will be able to create a SaltStack Config Target based on any of the TAGs. I like the formatting that is used for the grains file by using the function grains.append. SaltStack Config Targets: When I add the vCenter TAG information to the grains file I am then able to create SaltStack Config Targets based on the grain “vCenterTags”.

I have a specific use case that made me start looking at grains. In VMware vCenter I use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs. I also use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs in vRealize Operations. I want to use the same logic of using vCenter TAGs in SaltStack Config. SaltStack Config does not use vCenter TAGs OOTB (Out of the Box) for VMs. At the end of this Blog Post I also have an SaltStack Config Orchestration example. Instead of running multiple Jobs one at a time I have (4) steps in a SLS file that I run using a salt-run job and the function state.orchestrate.

This is where all files need to be saved when you use function cp.get_file. Step 3: Copy the csv file to the salt minions You may be wondering why I copy the file to the minion and not copy to a central share. My environment has NSX-T with zero trust. Most of my automation I do not open ports to servers that are not needed permanently. So the concept of using salt to copy files to minions, use the files to make changes and then delete the files when processes are complete works well in a zero trust environment.

Working with Jobs helped me understand how to make changes Ad-Hoc. I have a Job to quickly stop the Print Spooler but what if I always want the state of the Print Spooler Service to be stopped. How do I NOT allow a Server Admin to login into the server and manually start the service? This is where beacons and reactors work with minion configurations that you want to make permanent. This is the configuration Management Part of Salt Stack. To always make sure a Windows Service is stopped I created a beacon.conf file. On a Windows Server the Beacon.conf needs to be in the ‘C:\\salt\\conf\\minion.d' folder. Anytime a beacon.conf file is added to a minion or modified the salt-minion service needs restarted. I have a salt Job to restart the salt-minion service. Beacons: Beacon File: Sends events to the event bus on the salt master from a minion This beacon.conf example is for service state changes.

This blog is a work in progress on my journey with Salt. I started at zero and let’s see what I discover as I work towards getting to PROD. So if this topic is interesting to you, check back often. I wanted to learn one of the server configuration products that are available like Salt, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc… but I wasn’t sure which would be the best choice long term. When VMware purchased SaltStack Config the product to choose became a lot easier for me. SaltStack Config is included with vRealize Suite for licensing and I can call VMware support for help, SaltStack Config became the obvious product to pick. I like to show how to use VMware vRealize Products from a Windows Server Admin point of view. I do work with both Windows Servers and Linux Servers but most information you see online with Salt is using Linux Servers. I also do most of my current automation with PowerShell scripts. I do not want to lose all the time invested into the logic with my current PowerShell scripts. I am not going to go thru the process to install SaltStack Config. There is already some very good blogs written on installing SaltStack Config. One item I would recommend with installing Salt-Stack Config is to use VMware vRealize Life Cycle Manager (“LCM”). LCM makes the process to install SaltStack Config a lot easier. This Blog is assuming you already installed SaltStack Config, now how do I use salt and what do I use salt for. Installing and Configuring SaltStack Config The first step (minions): After you get a working SaltStack Config Server setup, the first item you need to do is add the salt agent to some “Test” servers. Servers that have the salt agent installed are called minions. There is the option to not add the salt agent to servers but then you need to use SSH to connect. Windows Servers do not have SSH available as default so you would need to install an SSH server like OpenSSH on your servers. My thoughts are I need to add something for the minions to communicate with the salt-master. Instead of adding OpenSSH to every Windows Server I chose to install and use the salt agent. For testing you can manually install the minion agent on a server to become familiar with how the salt commands work. During the install there are two values you need to enter. The name of the master and the name you want to use for the minion. I did that on my first couple test servers but then I created some PowerShell code to install the salt minion agent. # ----- [ Install minion ] ----------------------------------------------- # Define Username/Password $username = 'username@vCROCS.info' # The next line is how to create the encrypted password # Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter your password - username\" -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Out-File \"C:\\PWkey\\username.key\" $password = Get-Content \"C:\\PWkey\\username.key\" | ConvertTo-SecureString $cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $username, $password # ----- [ This section connects you to vCenter where VM is located ] ----- # Connect to vCenter vCenterName = 'vCenter.vCROCS.info' Connect-VIServer $vCenterName -Credential $cred # ----- [ Install Salt Agent ] ------------------------------------------- # Name of Server to install the salt minion agent $vmName = 'DBH-217' # Copy the minion agent file to your windows server Copy-VMGuestFile -Source G:\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe -Destination 'C:\\vCROCS' -VM $vmName -LocalToGuest -GuestCredential $cred # command string to install the Salt Minion Agent $PSText = 'C:\\vCROCS\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe /S /master=salt /minion-name=' + $vmName # Run the command on remote Server Invoke-VMScript -VM $VMName -ScriptType bat -ScriptText $PSText -GuestCredential $cred After the minion agent is installed on your server you need to accept the key on the s","date":"2021-07-16","objectID":"/saltstack-config-part-01/:0:0","tags":["SaltStack Config","VMware Aria Automation","vRealize Automation","PowerShell","Windows Server","Configuration Management"],"title":"VMware vRealize SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin - Part 1","uri":"/saltstack-config-part-01/"},{"categories":["vRealize Operations","VMware Aria"],"content":"Using vROPS Data to help show APP Owners Proper VM Sizing: vRealize Operations does a good job to show you what the correct number for vCPU/Memory settings should be based on monitoring history.

A question the APP Owners always ask is WHY should we take resources away from a VM to make the performance better. If you look at the Column CPU|Remove and then look at the column CPU|Ready (ms), the CPU|Ready (ms) is much higher on VMs that are NOT Right Sized. In one Dashboard I am showing several CPU performance metrics, vSAN performance metrics, CPU configuration (Counts/Hot ADD) and Right Sizing. I like to be able to look at all these metrics at the same time. Nice to be able to see if there is a relationship between performance, latency and Right Sizing. Does CPU performance affect the vSAN performance? Here is a VM that CPU|Remove is 0 and the CPU|Ready (ms) is much lower. Why is that? Dashboard Screen Shot: Click to see Larger Image VM Names were removed from screen Shot Click here to Download Dashboard and Views from VMware Code Web Site CPU | Ready (ms) metric after using vROPS Right Size recommendation: Click to see Larger Image This metric chart is showing a VM that had 12 CPU. vROPS recommended that the CPU count be 10. Before VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 1500 - 2000 (ms). After the VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 500 - 600 (ms). If you would do this across 100s of VMs in a cluster you would see even more performance gains because then the “Noisy Neighbors” would not be as Noisy. Performance Values: CPU|Ready (ms) should be 1000 or less for best performance CPU|Remove - I like to keep this at 2 or less. For some applications this can be trial and error. CPU|Add - I like to keep this at 0. Make sure the VM is sized with enough resources. Don’t under size VMs. This will keep the APP Owners Happy!

There is some documentation available but not a lot of details on how to get and use variables, sdk-objects and bearer token for permission. Here is how I made the vRO REST API calls with PowerShell using vRealize Orchestrator built-into vRA. Steps: Permission: Need to get a Bearer Token from vRO to make REST API Call to execute Workflow. To get a Bearer Token you need to make an REST API Call with username/password. See example code. Workflow Information: Get Workflow ID. Get Workflow variable inputs. Get sdk-object names from a successful Workflow run. See Screen Shots and sample code. Run the Workflow you want to use REST API with manually at least one time successfully. When you look at the variables of a successful Workflow run it shows you what the Workflow is expecting for variables and sdk-objects. See Screen Shots. Code to get bearer Token (PowerShell): You can’t use vRO REST API without getting bearer token first. (Note: When vRealize Automation 8.4 was released there was a small change to api to get Bearer Token. See the changes in the code area. Everything else has stayed the same for my processes.) # Get Bearer Token from vRA REST API Call # Some of the commented lines are in the code for testing.

Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I create Windows/Linux VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.x, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. In my vRA 7.6 environment, I use a PowerShell Host to run processes and on the PowerShell Host is where I install all the PS Modules that I use. When I started looking at how to use PowerShell with vRA 8.2 the one item that I needed to understand was how to use PowerShell Modules. VMware does have a Blog Post on how to include PowerShell modules with ABX Actions/vRO Work Flows - Click Here to see the Blog Post. After doing some testing and reviewing my options I decided to continue to use a PowerShell Host with vRA 8.2. What this allows me to do is use the same exact PowerShell Host for 7.6 and 8.2. The existing PS scripts that I have also work with both 7.6 and 8.2. No changes to any scripts and the PS Host. I like how VMware included PS as an options for all scripts within vRA 8.2. Hopefully in the future VMware will allow you to install your own PS Modules directly in the vRA Appliance. The one item that some people may not like about this setup is it does require an additional Windows Server that a standard vRA setup does not require. But to be able to use an existing Windows PS Host that can be shared between vRA 7.6 and 8.2 until I get my environment to 100% vRA 8.2 also has it positives. With Automation there is always many ways to complete the same task. I wrote a Blog Post previously that describes how to pass Cloud Template inputs/properties to ABX Actions. This Post is really using that same technique but instead of only running an ABX Action, this ABX Action Script is passing the inputs/customproperties onto a PowerShell Host. Here is link to previous post: VREALIZE AUTOMATION 8.2 - POWERSHELL ABX. By passing the custom properties as parameters to a PS Host I can also use PS Modules to connect to SQL servers and many other options. Basically any PS Module that is available can be used. Details on how to use a ABX Script with a PowerShell Host: Step 1: Create a Cloud Template. (See included yaml code and screen shot). Create inputs for the parameters you need to send to a PS script that will run on the PS Host. The inputs are the values that are used for the resource/properties. (See included yaml code) Create Properties in the resources section of the yaml for the inputs you just created. These properties will be the parameters that get passed to the PS Script. The properties get passed to the ABX script using $payload. (See included PS code) Step 2: Create a PowerShell ABX Action. (See included PS code and screen shot) To get the custom properties from the Cloud Template you need to use $payload. $payload.customProperties.\"Properties Name\" is how you get the values from the $payload. You can assign the custom properties to a variable within the ABX PS code. I use Invoke-VMScript to run the PS Script on the PS Host because my environment is also a Zero Trust Environment. Invoke-VMScript allows me to run PS scripts on remote servers without opening ports to the remote servers. Step 3: Create a Subscription. See Screenshot. The subscription is want runs the ABX scripts. A subscription can be Fired before or after a compute resource gets provisioned. I create a subscription for both in my environment. Within the subscription is where you define which ABX script is run. If you would want to string several ABX scripts together, the subscription could also run a ABX Flow. Sample Code and Screen Shots: Cloud Template: Click to see Larger Image The properties under resources in the yaml code will be used like parameters in a PS Script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties.

The one question that almost always gets asked is, how are you able to do everything that you have setup in your environment. After being asked this question a lot I thought I would give my thoughts in a Blog Post. Here is my “Recipe for Success”: Ingredients: Enjoy what you do. Give Back. Be involved in the vCommunity Enjoy where you work. Enjoy who you work with. Work at a place where management supports you. Don’t be afraid of change. Always keep track of what the industry is doing. Use Social Media like Twitter. Setup a Home Lab Learn, Learn, Learn! Think outside of the box Directions: The most important ingredient is to enjoy what you do. I have worked in the IT industry for 25+ years and I still have a Passion for it. I feel that I get paid to do my hobby. I am fascinated every day when I see some of the new technology that get released. There are some very smart people in the IT industry. I can truly say that I love what do for a job! When I create Automation that makes processes consistent and faster for the Team that I work with, I get a feeling that I have accomplished something. “Feel Good”/’Proud” feeling inside. Attend and Participate in user groups. VMUG, “Little Hacks”, SQL, HVC, PowerBlocks, Under The Hoods, etc… I started out by just attending and learning. I met a lot of people at the user groups. I now consider some of those people friends. After several years of being an attendee, I felt like I wanted to Give Back and start sharing some of the ideas that I have done. So, I started doing presentations myself. Everyone has something to share. Work for a Team that isn’t afraid of change. I say tear down the “Silos” and have everyone work together more. I have heard people say that Automation will eliminate my job. If you are an engineer, Automation will get the mundane items off your list. Let you focus more on Engineering type of tasks. The Cool Stuff! vRA: Start simple. Don’t try and have a 100 processes in your first Catalog item. Keep adding additional steps to the Catalog item until you cross off everything that needs to be done. Prove to management that the simple Automation is working and being used every day. My Automation is in a constant state of change. Always trying to make it better. Constantly including new processes. vROPS: Start my making some simple Dashboards with Heat Maps that show the Health of Items. Show your Hosts, VMs, Clusters. Start simple just like I said with Automation. You can then keep adding widgets to the Dashboards to give more information and make them more useful. Look at the “Text Display” widget to let you show information not included within vROPS. Have a goal of using vROPS as your “Single Pane of Glass”. Go to conferences. In 2020 since almost all conferences were online and free, I attended at least 6. Even if there was only one or two sessions that I wanted to attend, I took the time. Twitter is an awesome place to keep up. Use Twitter Lists to keep the “Garbage” out of you feed. I follow a lot of Technology businesses and Bloggers. Find people that have similar interests. Tech Companies are always giving updates about their products on Twitter. They post information about webinars that I find very useful. My Twitter Lists are public if you want to get started. Setup a Lab area of some type to be able to learn all the vRealize Products. One way to get a Home Lab started is to use VMware Fusion on Macs or VMware Workstation on PC’s. You can install nested ESXi on Fusion/Workstation. I have a Packt subscription that gives me access to a lot of Technology Books on a lot of topics. Well worth the money. Starting a Blog is a great way to start #GivingBack. Hugo is a great static site generator. You can use Github at no cost to store and host the web pages generated from Hugo.","date":"2021-01-15","objectID":"/recipe-for-success/:0:0","tags":["vExpert 2021","VMware","vRealize Automation","vRealize Operations","vRealize","Salt","SaltStack Config","PowerShell","Goals","Career","Training"],"title":"How to be successful with VMware vRealize Products in your environment","uri":"/recipe-for-success/"},{"categories":["vRealize Operations"],"content":"Creating Charts with ChartJS and displaying in vRealize Operations I like the idea of using VMware vRealize Operations as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring.

I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the “Text Display” Widget. The first thought I had was to display the weather for both the data center locations where I work. This could be used with a NOC type Dashboard. I looked online for a weather widget site and got the code to display the weather for the specific locations. If you go to Administration/Configuration/Metric Configurations/TxtWidgetContent you can create html files to save the widget code. See examples in images below. You can display any Widget data from any web site that provides widgets using the “Text Display” Widget. After I successfully added weather widgets I wanted to get more serious and show data from a SQL Database. I use a SQL database to store data from some vRealize Automation Day 2 BluePrints that I created. Some example BluePrints where I store data in a SQL DB are Server Builds and Server Decomissions. I created a web page that displayed the SQL Data and added another “Text Display” widget to the Dashboard. I used the url of the web page and assigned it to the widget and now I am also able to show SQL Data on a Dashboard. The reason I wanted to show Weather and SQL data is to use vRealize Operations Dashboards as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring. I have never seen a demo from VMware to use the “Text Display” Widget this way but I think this is awesome. This could completely change the way I use vRealize Operations Dashboards. There are not always vRealize Operations Management Packs available and this provides a cool way to show any data on a Dashboard. The data will be for reference only but it does allow the “Single Pane of Glass”. vRealize Operations Dashboard: Click to see Larger Image Here is a closeup of the Dashboard so you can see the details.

Click to see Larger Image Select the html file created to show the widget data Click to see Larger Image url Page: Click to see Larger Image The url web page could be a static or dynamic page. Use whatever works best for you. I think this opens up so many possibilities of what you can display on a Custom Dashboard. If you want to take it a step further you could publish the Custom vRealize Operations Dashboard with Workspace One and provide the data to anyone in your organization even if they are not a vRealize Operations user.

Smart Desk: Like most people that work in the Technology Field, I have been “WFH” (Working From Home) since the beginning of March. I already had a dedicated office area but it wasn’t setup for full time employment. I always liked a L-Shaped desk and I had this layout by pushing to straight desks together. Worked OK but could use improvement. So I started looking at new desks. I had two requirements, L-Shaped and I also wanted my next desk to be a standup Desk. I reviewed a lot of desks online and I decided to go with the L-Shaped Smart Desk from Autonomous. I am the type of person that usually likes to “touch and feel” this type of purchase to make sure the quality is good but after reviewing what other people were saying about Autonomous I decided to make the purchase. My biggest concern was damage during shipping. Click to see Larger Image When the desk was delivered I was impressed by how well the desk was packaged. Autonomous does a great job making sure nothing gets damaged. Everything arrived OK and there was no damage or missing pieces. The desk is heavy to put together by yourself. I took my time so I wouldn’t damage anything and the process to assemble was very easy. The directions were good. All the holes in the top are pre-drilled, which make it very nice to align all the pieces. The corners on the top are all slightly rounded and the edges are all eased. That really adds to the look and feel. I was impressed. I’m sure this also helps in shipping so that the top doesn’t get damaged. The quality of the top is so nice that a mouse does not work without a mouse pad. I did have to purchase a mouse pad to use with this desk. A black mouse pad on a black top looks good. I like the wire management included with the desk. I think I will be ordering a couple of the Autonomous Desk Clamp Power Outlets to make wire management even better. All my Apple Space Grey items look good on the Black top. I am anxious to see how often I will use the desk while standing and if I will like to be standing while programming. There is enough room on the L-Shaped desk to hold (3) monitors, (2) Mac Mini’s, external drives, iPad, iPhone, MacBook Pro, AirPods, HomePod, Microsoft Surface Pro, Dell Work Laptop, Shure Mic and a Google Home (Yes I am an Apple Fanboy). Happy with my Smart Desk decision. Click to see Larger Image VMware Home Lab: In addition to upgrading my Home Office Desk, it was time to upgrade my VMware Home Lab. My HPE GEN 6 DL380 was not on the VMware supported hardware list anymore and generated a lot of heat and noise in the Home Office. I already had an Apple Mac Mini with VMware Fusion installed but it didn’t have a lot of memory installed. I used it to run some small VMs but mainly used the DL380 for my Homelab. So I upgraded the memory on the Mac mini to 64 GB. I also purchased a second Mac Mini and upgraded the memory to 64 GB. So now my Homelab consists of (2) Mac Mini’s with a total of 128 GB memory. I have multiple nested ESXi 7.0 Hosts installed on each Mac Mini using VMware Fusion. The setup has worked well for me so far. No noise and heat like I had with the DL380. Plus I can use the Mac Mini’s for more than just a Homelab. Turn on the ESXi Hosts when needed and then just power off to do my normal everyday computing. If I don’t want to run the VMs on ESXi, I can also just run VMs directly on Fusion. Click to see Larger Image So a month after making my Home Lab work with Apple Mac Mini’s, Apple decides to make all new Apple computers with ARM processors. I guess my next Home Lab upgrade will not be Apple Computers. I will probably look at using Intel NUCs or something like the NUC for my next Home Lab.

The setup of the plugin is straight forward; follow the documentation and you’ll likely be set. However, if you use custom DNS views in Infoblox (internal, external, etc.) then some additional configuration is required that’s not easily identified. Out of the box, the Infoblox IPAM integration comes with only a few default properties.

Here are some of my favorites: IT Reality Virtual Speaking Podcast Develop Great Managers vBrown Bag Automators Mac Power Users Twit Network of Podcasts I have had an interest to be a guest on a Podcast for several years. I always thought to myself, when I get to a point in my career that I could share my knowledge, I would try and be a guest on a Podcast. After doing several presentations about VMware vRealize Automation, I wanted the next step to be a guest spot on a Podcast to reach a larger audience. When I saw a post on Twitter that the IT Reality Podcast was looking for everyday Technology people passionate about a topic and willing to share the knowledge, I reached out to them to show my interest in appearing on their Podcast. We had a meeting and the Hosts felt I had a good story to tell, so we scheduled a time to record the Podcast. The hosts, Vince Wood and Sam Larch, were awesome to work with. They also invited Nathan Bennett to be on the episode as a guest and he was also great to talk with. The experience to talk with these guys was a good way for me to appear on a Podcast. While recording the Podcast I learned some knowledge from Nathan that I will use in my current Automation environment. If it wasn’t for other people sharing knowledge by creating Blogging web sites or appearing on Podcasts, I wouldn’t have the knowledge that I do today. I hope that I can give back to the vCommunity like they have done for me. I would encourage anyone who wants to share their knowledge to Just Do It!

Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I am going to create Windows Server VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.1, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. No vRO (Orchestrator) Workflows will be used. This is completely different compared to how I create Windows Servers with vRA 7.6. The enterprise organizations that I have worked for are 90%+ Microsoft Windows Servers. It is important for me to have vRA be able to create Windows Servers and make all configuration changes using PowerShell. You could also use this technique to make changes to a Linux VM using the PowerCLI commands Invoke-VMscript and Copy-VMGuestFile. I did create a Blog Post on this topic. BluePrint Requirements: I want to manually enter the VM Name. I don’t want an auto generated name. After the Windows Server VM is created I want to to able to add vCenter TAGS to VM, make some OS changes, and install software based on values entered on the BluePrint. What I created to accomplish the requirements: Created a BluePrint. See included code and screen shot. Created a PowerShell Action. See included code and screen shot. Created a Subscription. See Screenshot. Sample Code and Screen Shots:— BluePrint: Click to see Larger Image The properties under resources in the yaml code can be used like parameters in a PowerShell script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties. When you deploy the BluePrint the values entered that I defined will not be used until the Action runs. The Action will run after the “Compute post provision” event is triggered with the subscription. Those values will be passed from the BluePrint to the Action. Just like passing parameters to a PS script. # This is the yaml code for the BluePrint # Created by vCrocs.info formatVersion: 1 inputs: cpuCount: type: integer description: Number of virtual processors default: 2 totalMemoryMB: type: integer description: Machine virtual memory size in Megabytes default: 2048 VMname: type: string default: DBH00 SQL: type: boolean description: Is this a SQL Server? default: false D-Drive-Size: type: integer description: 'Enter D:\\ Size in GB' default: 10 minimum: 5 maximum: 50 TEST: type: string enum: - 'Yes' - 'No' resources: Cloud_vSphere_Machine_1: type: Cloud.vSphere.Machine properties: name: '${input.VMname}' SQL: '${input.SQL}' DDRive: '${input.D-Drive-Size}' imageRef: 2019-TEMPLATE cpuCount: '${input.cpuCount}' totalMemoryMB: '${input.totalMemoryMB}' TEST: '${input.TEST}' constraints: - tag: 'quick_start_run:1' —Using the Inputs Screen helps you build the BluePrint yaml code.

I use to troubleshoot and understand how it is working. I am able to take values from the payload customProperties and assign to variables.

I Blog about Subjects and Products that I find interesting and will hopefully help someone get started on their Automation, Monitoring and Logging journey by providing some tips | tricks | processes | code needed. My focus is Automation, Monitoring and Logging. When I was a VMware customer I created an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Environment. I used VMware vRealize Automation and SaltStack Config to complete server builds, software installs, schedule VM snap shots, Microsoft 365 automation, Citrix Management, Automate Data Center Flips, Server Decommissions, and many other Day 2 processes… For monitoring I used vRealize Operations for the “Single Pane of Glass” experience. I also used vRealize Log Insight for logging and LCM (Life Cycle Manager) for installing all the vRealize Products. Almost all the code I write to complete the Automation that I create is done with PowerShell. The reason I choose to use PowerShell is because to do Automation with VMware products, VMware has a PowerShell module named PowerCLI. There hasn’t been anything that I wanted to Automate that I haven’t been able to do with PowerShell. I have also done Automation with Azure. I am using PowerShell to create VMs and SaltStack Config to complete the configuration management, install software and maintain state. \"Your thought process is the most powerful automation tool you’ll ever have!\" - Cody De Arkland vCommunity I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this Blog Site as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful. The code that I have shared on this Blog Site is code that I use with vRealize Automation Cloud Templates/Catalog Items and everyday VMware Admin functions. Everyday I learn something new. If I think it should be shared I will write a blog about it. Check back often to see what I am doing next. “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do, We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.” - Steve Jobs Thanks!
