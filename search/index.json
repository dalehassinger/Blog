[{"content":"VMware Explore 2025 was the best conference that I\u0026rsquo;ve ever attended.\nVMware Explore 2025 was unforgettable — my Hackathon team placed 1st, I presented or co-presented 5 Expert Led Workshops in the Hands-On Labs, topped the HOL leaderboard for High-Quality customer conversations, Recorded a Virtually Speaking Podcast, and I had an awesome dinner with two of my role models. Energized by positive customer discussions and the amazing vCommunity!\nVMware Explore 2025 I want to start by thanking Delta Airlines for a smooth travel experience to and from Vegas this year. No delays, no cancellations—everything ran on time. Travel can sometimes be unpredictable, so this hassle-free trip was a welcome relief.\nStaying at The Palazzo Hotel was a great experience. The suites were spacious and comfortable, and the walk to the conference was quick and convenient. I also enjoyed some excellent meals during my stay, with standout dining experiences at Bouchon, Delmonico, TAO Asian Bistro, Noodle Asia, and CHICA.\nThe VMware Explore 2025 Conference was, for me personally, one of the best I’ve attended. Overall, it was a very positive experience.\nMy Hackathon Team earned first place I presented or co-presented five Expert-Led Workshops in the HOL area. I gave a presentation in the Discovery Theater alongside Don Horrox I recorded a Virtually Speaking Podcast about the Hackathon I enjoyed a nice dinner with Brock Peterson and Cosmin Trif, two people who have been great role models in my career In the Hands-on Labs (HOL) area, conversations with customers were very encouraging. Many were eager to learn about VCF 9, and a large number attended HOL sessions as part of their preparation for the VCF certification exams I felt the energy at VMware Explore 2025 was very similar to the earlier years when the conference was known as VMworld. While overall attendance may have been lower, the quality of the event was noticeably higher than in the past year or two. Personally, I’ll take quality over quantity any day.\nMany of the people I spoke with were taking the VCF 9 certification tests offered at the conference. That’s a strong sign of the growing interest and momentum around VCF 9 across the industry.\nHackathon The Hackathon is always a fun and rewarding event for me. This year, I had the honor of serving as a Team Captain, and our team finished in 1st place. After placing 2nd for the past two years, achieving first this year was especially meaningful.\nOur project, a PowerShell MCP Server, was an absolute blast to design and test. One of our main goals was to enable the re-use of existing PowerCLI scripts within an MCP Server—something we were excited to bring to life during the Hackathon.\nHackathon Team Members:\nOur Hackathon team was made up of Don, Amos, Cosmin, and Willie. Don and Amos joined as soon as the Hackathon was announced, while Cosmin and Willie jumped in the evening of the event. It turned out to be a fantastic group, and I’m happy to call all of them friends.\nI always look forward to the opportunity each year to have conversations with the Hackathon Judges, Alan Renouf and William Lam. Back when I was a customer, if either of them had sessions at VMware Explore, those were always the first I registered for.\nTo now have these role models serve as Hackathon judges—and to have them select the project I captained as the winning entry—was an incredibly proud moment in my career.\nHackathon Links:\nAnnouncing Hackathon Explore in Las Vegas\nBroadcom News article about the Hackathon\nHackathon Pics:\nHere are some screenshots of the Dashboards our Hackathon Team created using the PowerShell MCP Server:\nThe MCP Server provides the connection to the data We connected to VCF, vCenter, VCF Operations, and a Network Switch Data is retrieved through prompts, and reports are generated automatically based on those prompts No additional coding is required to create the reports Beyond retrieving data, we also built MCP Tools that can send email, create DNS records, and save HTML reports directly to a specified web server folder Pics from the Hackathon Event:\nWe also walked away with some awesome prizes and a really cool Hackathon T-shirt—a fun bonus on top of an already amazing experience.\nHackathon Comic Book:\nI created the Comic Book to show how prompts can create some amazing results I used ChatGPT-5 to create the Comic Book Hands-On Labs I was a member of the Hands-On Labs Expert-Led Workshop (ELW) Team at VMware Explore 2025. Our team of eight included Christopher Lewis, Shannon Fitzpatrick, William DeMarigny, Cosmin Trif, Scott Bowe, Brock Peterson, Alexis Rondeau, and myself.\nI had the opportunity to present or co-present with Shannon Fitzpatrick, William DeMarigny, Scott Bowe, and Brock Peterson.\nWhen I wasn’t involved with the ELWs, I spent time in the Self-Paced HOL area, helping customers choose courses, get logged in, and ensure they had a great experience. The conversations I had there were very positive—time after time, customers shared how eager they were to learn about VCF 9 and get up to speed with the latest version. Their excitement around using VCF 9 was encouraging.\nNot every customer feels that way, but after a few days of talking with so many engaged attendees, I left feeling really good about the vCommunity.\nThe Wednesday before VMware Explore, the local VMUG hosted a vBeers event, and the conversations there carried the same theme. The local VMUG chapter has asked me to start doing VCF 9 presentations, and attendees expressed interest in meeting more frequently. It’s great to see the community’s energy continuing to grow.\nHands-On Labs Pics:\nExpert Led Workshop Team:\nSelf Paced HOL Area:\nI Love the HOL Command Center All the Dashbaords are created with VCF Operations I want to walk into a Customer NOC someday and see a wall that looks like this\u0026hellip; Top 20 HOL Courses Attended During VMware Explore 2025:\nWhen I joined VMware, Brock Peterson was the one who covered my account while I was still a customer. After I accepted my role at VMware, I sent Brock a text saying, “Maybe someday we’ll get the chance to present together.”\nAt VMware Explore 2025, that became a reality—we co-presented an HOL Expert-Led Workshop. The feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive, and I truly hope we’ll have the opportunity to do more presentations together in the future.\nIn addition to working with Brock when I was a customer, Cosmin was also a good resource who supported me along the way. VMware Explore 2025 was the first time the three of us were together in the same place. We shared a great dinner and some meaningful conversations.\nBrock and Cosmin are the best kind of coworkers—talented, supportive, and genuinely great to work with.\nMy VMware Explore 2025 Discovery Theater Session Enhancing VMware Cloud Foundation Operation Management Packs with PowerShell | CODEQT1121LV Session Description:\nIn this session, we will explore how to create VMware Cloud Foundation® (VCF) Operations Management Packs (MPs) using PowerShell to retrieve the data. We will demonstrate how to use PowerShell to run scripts to gather information that can be used to build custom MPs, especially when APIs are not available. PowerShell, with the addition of PowerShell Modules, is a powerful way to get data sources into your MPs, expanding the scope of your monitoring capabilities. Learn how to think outside the box by creating MPs that go beyond traditional API integration and access data that is not readily available via standard APIs. This session will empower you to innovate and create custom MPs tailored to your specific operational needs. Discover how a PowerShell script can serve as an API frontend for your automation workflows.\nDetails:\nI shared the Discovery Theater Stage with Don Horrox, Systems Engineer. I first met Don when he was a VMware customer that I worked with, and I was immediately struck by his deep passion for VMware technologies. Since then, it’s been a pleasure collaborating and presenting multiple times with him. Check out Don\u0026rsquo;s blog, vChamp, to see what he has been sharing with the vCommunity.\nThe questions and feedback we received from the presentation were excellent. I feel we were able to share some new ideas that attendees hadn’t considered before and get them thinking about their own use cases. Management Packs (MPs) can open the door to many interesting and creative monitoring possibilities.\nCODEQT1121LV Announcement: Don and I on the Discovery Theater stage: VMware Explore 2025 Swag:\nI was able to bring home some very cool VMware Explore swag this year. For me, these items are more than just giveaways—they each carry personal meaning. The Raspberry Pi was awarded for serving as captain of the Hackathon team that finished in first place. The Hands-On Labs power brick was awarded for having the most high-quality conversations with customers in the HOL area. Not only does the Virtually Speaking podcast deliver some of the best content you can listen to, but they also give away the coolest power bricks around. I received mine after recording a podcast about the Hackathon. It was a great experience working with Pete and John. Venetian Conference Center The Venetian Conference Center is great because it offers the convenience of having everything under one roof. The rooms are comfortable, and the conference food for breakfast and lunch was particularly good this year. There are also plenty of options for a nice dinner. I had dinner at Delmonico one evening, and as always, the food was excellent.\nVMware Community Podcast After VMware Explore I had the pleasure of being a guest on the CMTY Podcast 738, Wrapping Up VMware Explore Las Vegas, 2025. We discussed the VMware Explore Hackathon and other vCommunity activities. You can listen to the podcast on YouTube. Link to Podcast\nFinal Thoughts: I hope I get the opportunity to do it all again next year. VMware Explore is always one of my favorite weeks of the year. I appreciate the chance to give back to the vCommunity, which I believe is incredibly strong. I\u0026rsquo;ve never encountered another user group where the members are as passionate about a product as the VMware community is. The Hackathon Project has a lot of details I can share. I am going to dedicate a Blog to the topic. My Discovery Theater presentation, Enhancing VMware Cloud Foundation Operation Management Packs with PowerShell | CODEQT1121LV, also has a lot of details I can share.

My wife and I love camping. She’s happiest relaxing at the beach with a good book, while I enjoy riding my E-Bike on nearby trails. Our favorite destination is the Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach area in Delaware.\nE-Bike Dealers in the area that I had good experiences:\nPEDALTEC ELECTRIC BIKES Lewes Cycle Sports We usually stay at one of the Delaware State Parks. If you\u0026rsquo;re considering a trip, plan ahead—reservations fill up fast and often need to be made a year in advance. The beginning of July is a special time for us, as it’s both my wife’s birthday and our anniversary. It’s a week we always try to set aside for camping.\nOur go-to spot is Delaware Seashore State Park. While my wife unwinds by the ocean, soaking in the sights and sounds, I head out on my E-Bike to Gordon’s Pond and ride the trail to Cape Henlopen State Park.\nWe kicked off this trip with our first night at Killens Pond State Park. It was our first time camping there, and we really enjoyed the peaceful, wooded setting. One thing to note—there was no Starlink coverage at our campsite. There was very heavy tree cover and I could not get Starlink to work.\nThe Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach area is also home to some great restaurants we love visiting. I usually take the opportunity to enjoy seafood whenever we dine out, since I don’t cook it often at home.\nBluecoast Bethany Off the Hook One tech upgrade that’s really changed our camping experience is Starlink. As long as we have a clear view of the sky, it works flawlessly. We’re able to stream YouTube TV in the camper just like we would at home—blending our love for the outdoors with a little touch of modern convenience. This Blog was posted while sitting in the camper using Starlink for internet access.\nAnother piece of technology I rely on when towing our camper is the Garmin RV Navigator. It helps avoid roads that aren’t suitable for RVs, including those with low overpasses or weight restrictions. Unlike Google or Apple Maps, it\u0026rsquo;s built specifically with RV travel in mind—making it a much safer choice when towing. I would never recommend towing an RV using only Google or Apple Maps. They’re just not designed with RV-specific routes in mind, which can lead to dangerous situations like low clearances or restricted roads.\nI’m also a big fan of the towing technology built into today’s pickup trucks. We have a Chevrolet 2500, and one of my favorite features is what happens when you plug in a trailer—when you activate the turn signal, the large dash display shows a live camera view of the side of the truck and the entire length of the camper.\nIt’s a great safety feature, especially when other drivers are impatient and try to pass at the worst times. Towing doesn’t always get the respect it deserves on the road—everyone seems to be in a rush and eager to get around an RV as quickly as possible.\nA great way to securely access your home lab while camping with Starlink internet is by using Twingate. Unlike traditional VPNs, there’s no need to open remote ports. I run a simple Rocky Linux VM with the Twingate connector, and it works seamlessly. The Twingate Starter Plan is a great (and free) way to get started.\nWhen I get home from this camping trip, it’ll be time to put the finishing touches on my VMware Explore 2025 session, Enhancing VMware Cloud Foundation Operation Management Packs with PowerShell - CODEQT1121LV. I also need to spend some time pulling together content for the VMware Explore Hackathon (I will be a Team Captain)—something I’m really looking forward to.\nIf you’re reading this and plan to attend VMware Explore 2025, feel free to look me up or stop by the Hands-on Labs (HOL) area. I’ll be spending a lot of time there this year as a member of the HOL team!\nCamping Pics: Indian River Inlet Bridge Indian River Inlet Bridge Indian River Inlet Bridge Delaware Seashore State Park Delaware Seashore State Park Delaware Seashore State Park Revelation Brewing - Rehoboth Beach, DE Indian River Inlet Bridge Gordon\u0026rsquo;s Pond State Park, DE - I love riding the elevated trail section Delaware Seashore Fresh Pond Trails Gordon\u0026rsquo;s Pond State Park, DE Delaware Seashore State Park Killens Pond State Park Delaware Seashore State Park Lessons Learned Make time for yourself and your family—it matters.

Recently, someone asked about the CPU|Overcommit ratio for a specific ESXi host. When I checked VCF Operations, I noticed that CPU|Overcommit metrics were available at the Datacenter and Cluster levels—but not at the Host level.\nTo address this gap, I built a Super Metric to calculate the CPU|Overcommit ratio at the host level. You can find the Super Metric formula below.\nTo make it easier to visualize CPU|Overcommit ratios across all levels—Datacenter, Cluster, and Host—I also created a custom dashboard. An example of this dashboard is shown below.\nCPU|Overcommit isn’t inherently a bad thing—in fact, it’s one of the main reasons we virtualize: to efficiently share physical resources across VMs. The key is finding a CPU|Overcommit ratio that works for your specific environment and workloads.\nThat’s why I included the VM Details widget in the dashboard—to help you monitor important metrics like CPU|Ready (ms). Different workloads and use cases will tolerate different levels of overcommit, so keep an eye on performance indicators and adjust accordingly.\nBy default, the CPU|Ready (ms) metric is not enabled in VMware Aria Operations. To activate it, navigate to Operations \u0026gt; Configuration \u0026gt; Policy Definition. Select your Default Policy, then click Edit Policy. Under Metrics and Properties, use the filter to search for \u0026ldquo;cpu|ready\u0026rdquo;. Select Virtual Machine, expand Metrics, then CPU. You’ll find Ready (ms) listed as Deactivated—switch it to Activated and save your changes.\nAllow for a few collection cycles (typically 10–15 minutes), and the CPU Ready (ms) metric will become available for monitoring VM performance.\nDashboard Example: Super Metric: 1 2 {‌ This Resource: ‌cpu|vcpus_allocated_on_all_powered_on_vms}/{‌This Resource: ‌cpu|corecount_provisioned } Lessons Learned: Host CPU|Overcommit isn\u0026rsquo;t a metric available OOTB (Out of the Box).

Last week, regional issues prevented users from joining scheduled meetings. This highlighted the need for alerts when SaaS tools experience problems.\nWhile I’ve created dashboards in the past to show the status of SaaS services using the Text Display widget, I wanted to take it a step further and receive email alerts from VCF Operations—just as I do for ESXi hosts, VMs, or storage issues.\nTo enable this, I built a Management Pack (MP) to bring the data into VCF Operations. Once the data is available, you can create dashboards, views, alerts, and reports—just like you would for any other monitored system.\nCreating Management Packs (MPs) with the MP Builder requires making API calls. I did some research and found that Zoom status information is available through a REST API.\nI’ve used the MP Builder before for other use cases, so I was already familiar with the process. Building the Zoom MP took about 30 minutes.\nSee the screenshots and steps below—it’s a straightforward process that anyone can follow.\nIn 2025, take some time to get hands-on with the MP Builder in VCF Operations. The platform already delivers solid monitoring out of the box, but when you start building your own Management Packs, that’s when it really starts to shine.\nDashboard Examples: Colors are very poweful in VCF Operations.

This blog post highlights a feature I only recently came across, and I’m excited to share it with you. My goal is to spark some ideas and inspire new use cases in your own automation journey.\nUse Case: Here’s a PowerShell use case I hadn’t come across until just last week: using a PowerShell script as a web server—no separate web server installation needed. Just run the script, and your machine starts listening for connections on the port you specify. This idea immediately got my wheels turning about all the possibilities this unlocks. You’ll find some example scripts included in this blog.\nAfter getting a basic listener running on port 8080 with a non-SSL connection, I was curious how complex it would be to switch to port 443 with SSL. A bit of research showed it doesn’t take much—just a few changes to the script. Examples of that are also included here.\nOnce I saw how simple it was to handle incoming web requests, I naturally started thinking: what if a PowerShell script could act as an API front end? I tweaked the listener script to respond to RESTful API requests—and just like that, PowerShell was replying with data to API calls. Not every system you need to pull data from has a REST API, but with this technique, you can make your own. That’s a game-changer for my automation.\nPowerShell Script for RESTful API Requests Use Case: One example is the VCF Operations Management Pack (MP) Builder, which needs to make REST API calls. With this setup, a PowerShell script can serve that role directly. If you can script it, you can expose it as an API and include the data within VCF Operations!\nIn my automation journey, I’ve yet to find something I couldn’t automate with PowerShell. Adding modules to your scripts unlocks even more use cases—like connecting to remote systems over SSH and parsing the results. Having a PowerShell script act as a RESTful API front end opens up endless possibilities for automation and integration.\nCode Examples: This example is a simple Web Server (non-ssl) that displays text along with the current date and time, which updates on every page load or refresh.\nScript can be used to show any web page and data you can create. Think about some cool use cases. The image demonstrates how the time updates on each page refresh, highlighting that the web page is dynamic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 # Web Server for Home Lab Use and a Nice way to see how PowerShell can be used. # Created By: Dale Hassinger param( [int]$port = 8080 # Define a port parameter with a default value of 8080 ) # Flag for cancellation, used to control when to stop the server $cancelled = $false # Register an event handler for Ctrl+C (ConsoleBreak) # When triggered, it sets the $cancelled flag to true so the server can stop gracefully $null = Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier ConsoleBreak -Action { Write-Host \u0026#34;`nCtrl+C detected.

This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task.

There\u0026rsquo;s no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.\nAlways test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.\nIf you found this blog article helpful and it assisted you, consider buying me a coffee to kickstart my day.\n","date":"2025-04-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://vcrocs.info/powershell-script-as-a-web/api-server/featured-image_hu_24c920e416d42b63.png","permalink":"https://vcrocs.info/powershell-script-as-a-web/api-server/","title":"PowerShell Script as a Web/API Server"},{"content":"Add CustomProperties to a VM Deployment after the Virtual Machine is created.\nUse CustomProperties in VMware VCF Automation to drive CMDB integration—keeping users and process logic out of vCenter where they don\u0026rsquo;t belong.\nNote: VCF Automation 8.18.1 was used to create this Blog\nI recently received a great question about using CustomProperties in VMware VCF Automation to keep the CMDB up to date—without relying on direct access to vCenter. I\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of this approach. Many organizations aim to limit who and what can access vCenter to maintain a secure and streamlined environment. The fewer hands in vCenter, the better—keep it lean and mean.\nAs part of the conversation, I was also asked how to capture a VM property that isn\u0026rsquo;t available out of the box in VCF Automation: the \u0026ldquo;bios id\u0026rdquo;. While you can retrieve it with PowerCLI by connecting to vCenter, the goal was to avoid pulling data from vCenter continuously just to populate the CMDB.\nFortunately, I found a Broadcom TechDoc that explains how to add CustomProperties to an existing VM deployment. I\u0026rsquo;m all about real-world examples, so below is how I added the \u0026ldquo;bios id\u0026rdquo; as a custom property to a deployed VM—no direct vCenter calls required to keep CMDB accurate and current.\nSteps: Steps to add a customProperty to a VM deployment:\nStart with a Design Template that includes the customProperties you want to associate with the VM during the build process. Set up a Subscription that triggers an ABX Action to run Post-Provisioning. When the new VM deployment starts, you will not see the customProperty \u0026ldquo;bios id\u0026rdquo; until after the ABX Action runs. The ABX Action connects to vCenter, retrieves the VM\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;bios id\u0026rdquo;, and writes it back as a customProperty on the deployment. This action only needs to run once—the \u0026ldquo;bios id\u0026rdquo; is static.

Linux ❤️ PowerShell!\nStreamline VMware Automation with VCF Automation, a Rocky Linux PowerShell host, custom workflows, and the simplicity of PowerCLI.\nI like using PowerShell on Linux in my Lab: In most cases, a PowerShell Host for VCF Automation Orchestrator is set up on a Windows Server, which works seamlessly. Having spent much of my career working with Microsoft Windows Server, I’m well-versed in its capabilities. However, in my lab, where resource efficiency is a priority, I prefer to run Linux VMs whenever possible. I keep these Linux VMs lean and mean for maximum performance.\nI set out to explore how a Rocky Linux VM could function as a PowerShell Host. By default, VCF Automation Orchestrator includes a workflow called “Run SSH Command”, designed to execute SSH commands on a server. I began testing with this built-in workflow and customized it to better align with my requirements.\nTo keep the setup simple, I wanted to create a single workflow where I could specify the PS script path and name. The Linux VM details—such as hostname, username, password, and port—would remain static.\nFor 2025, I’ve been invited to be a VMware Community {code} Coach!

All the scripts in this blog were created and tested on a Mac using PowerShell. Don’t dismiss PowerShell just because it was created by Microsoft. Embrace it to enhance your automation journey! Integrating PowerShell with YAML has been something I’ve wanted to explore for a while. I’m glad I took the time to develop the necessary code and share it with the vCommunity.

In this blog, I’ll share the scripts I created to automate this process.\nI have a VCF environment running in my lab on a nested ESXi host, (See my Blog to create an VCF in your lab with a script). My goal is to log into the ESXi host, gracefully shut down all VCF VMs, then log into vCenter to shut down the nested ESXi host. To ensure a clean shutdown, I’ve added logic to verify that all VMs are powered off before proceeding to the next steps.

Below, you\u0026rsquo;ll find example code and screenshots demonstrating the approach. If you\u0026rsquo;re working with array inputs in your automation workflows, this guide should be helpful!\nScreenshots demonstrating the use of VCF Automation Input Arrays:\nExample manual Deployment that has an Array Input Example Custom Form using an Array Input Screen Shot of the YAML Code for Input Array:\nDefine the input type as array Use the array input in the \u0026ldquo;Cloud.vSphere.Machine\u0026rdquo; - \u0026ldquo;properties:\u0026rdquo; section All properties values will get passed in the ABX Action Screen Shot of the Inputs:\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t worked with YAML array inputs before, use the Inputs screens in VCF Automation to assist in formatting the YAML correctly. This will ensure the data is structured properly before being passed to the ABX Action. Screen Shot of the Array Creation with Inputs:\nExample screen of creating an Array Screen Shot of the Subscription to execute an ABX Action during an VM Build:\nIn this example I am running an ABX Action during Pre Allocation of a new VM Build Screen Shot of the Array Creation with Inputs:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of PowerShell code that takes a YAML array string passed to an ABX Action, cleans it up, and converts it into a PowerShell array This is the most critical step in this blog post. Take the time to understand how the YAML string is transformed into a PowerShell array, as this enables you to leverage the array values for any automation tasks needed in your server build process. The PowerShell code processes the YAML string by replacing unnecessary characters, ensuring proper formatting, and then splitting the string on commas to create a PowerShell array. This transformation allows the data to be easily iterated and used within the ABX Action. Screen Shot of the YAML Array Values:\nThis example demonstrates how the YAML array format is passed to the ABX Action as a string. Understanding this format is essential for parsing and utilizing the array data effectively within your automation logic.

But it\u0026rsquo;s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains. - Steve Jobs\nProduct Versions used for this Blog:\nVMware Cloud Foundation: 5.2.1 PowerCLI: 13.3 PowerShell: 7.4.6 Use Case for Creating this Blog Goals: Leverage my existing Home Lab Hardware to start using and learning about VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF). Enable quick creation or re-creation of a VCF environment. Run VCF on a single Minisforum MS-01 using nested ESXi. For this use case, a vCenter is already set up and running with multiple physical ESXi hosts. Utilize Tiered Memory with the MS-01 to support more VMs and explore how Tiered Memory works. Run the Cloud Builder steps manually to gain hands-on experience, using a JSON file generated by the script for deployment. Install VCF 5.2.1 with the script, then manually upgrade to VCF 5.2.1.1 to learn how SDDC Manager performs upgrades. Manually create Workload Domains to better understand the deployment process and deepen learning. Add the line bringup.mgmt.cluster.minimum.size=1 to the file /etc/vmware/vcf/bringup/application.properties to enable VCF SDDC Manager to run on a single nested ESXi host. Ensure performance is sufficient for learning purposes, without requiring production-level speed. Initial Considerations: I explored VMware Holodeck as an option, but the resource requirements were too high for my setup.\nInspiration and Approach: I came across William Lam\u0026rsquo;s Blog about running VCF on a single NUC and decided to adapt that idea for my lab. William also provides a PowerShell script that automates the entire VCF installation in a single run. William\u0026rsquo;s script does require more than one ESXi Host.\nOutcome: After evaluating the available options, I decided to modify some of the example PowerShell scripts and processes to deploy and manage VCF in my Home Lab.\nThis blog serves as a guide to automate VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) deployment in a home lab environment. It is also designed as a learning resource for VCF, which is why some steps are performed manually.\nBy combining automation with hands-on tasks, the goal is to help you understand VCF deployment processes while enabling you to streamline repetitive tasks for future setups.\nWhether you\u0026rsquo;re exploring VCF for the first time or looking to optimize your home lab, this approach provides flexibility to learn, experiment, and refine your deployment strategies.\nThis blog post shares the scripts and the steps I followed to make it all work.\nHome Lab Hardware Primary Systems:\n(2) Minisforum MS-01 96 GB memory Intel Core i9-13900H (14 cores: 6 Performance + 8 Efficient) I use all cores and specify which cores to use per VM with Scheduling Affinity rules. VMs like VCF Automation and Operations, I use the performance cores. VMs with light use, I specify the Efficient Cores. Storage Configuration: 1 TB NVMe for Tiered Memory @ 400% (SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD NVMe) To specify the amount of tiered memory you want to use, you need to set a percentage. This percentage determines how much tiered memory is allocated relative to the physical memory. For example, in my lab, I have 96 GB of physical memory. Using a 400% tiered memory configuration:\n￼ - (96 GB * 400%) + 96 GB physical = 480 GB Total Memory. 4 TB NVMe for Storage (SAMSUNG 990 PRO SSD NVMe) 1 NVMe slot open for future expansion (1) MS-01 runs everything in my lab but the VCF environment (1) MS-01 is dedicated for this VCF environment. All VMs that it takes for a VCF environment Additional Systems:\n(2) Apple Mac Minis (Intel-based) Running Fusion and Nested ESXi 64 GB memory each Processors: 1 with Intel i3 1 with Intel i5 Thoughts on the Minisforum MS-01:\nI’m extremely satisfied with the Minisforum MS-01. If I expand my lab, I plan to add more MS-01 units. The MS-01 includes (2) SFP ports, and I’m considering adding 10 GbE networking to support future lab improvements. The MS-01 CPU fan will run continuously due to the high number of VMs running. PowerShell Scripts: Script Overview - Step 1\nPurpose: This script automates the creation of the Nested ESXi Host required by VCF Cloud Builder to deploy and configure the VCF environment.\nSteps Performed:\nCreate the Nested ESXi Host – Prepares the environment for VCF Cloud Builder to handle the installation and deployment process. This script is designed to install nested ESXi hosts and can be reused for various use cases. By keeping this step as a separate script, it allows flexibility for future deployments beyond this specific lab setup. Update this script with names and IP addresses that match your lab environment. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 # Script to add Nested ESXi Host # Author: Dale Hassinger # Based on Script by: William Lam and other vCommunity Web Sites # vCenter Server used to deploy VMware Cloud Foundation Lab $VIServer = \u0026#34;192.168.6.100\u0026#34;

Generate the JSON Configuration File – Creates the input file required by Cloud Builder to install the VCF Management Domain. The step to create the JSON file is worth reviewing. It is the easiest method I have found to generate the JSON file required for VCF Cloud Builder.

MAKE SURE DNS IS SETUP WITH THE NAMES AND IPs YOU SPECIFY IN THE SCRIPT! If the install fails, it is probably a DNS issue! This script takes approximately 1.25 to 1.5 hours to run and create a VCF SDDC Manager environment. If monitoring the logs, expect periods with no new log entries. Be patient—the process will complete. Example commands to monitor the install logs of Cloud Builder: tail -f -n 45 /var/log/vmware/vcf/bringup/vcf-bringup.log less /var/log/vmware/vcf/bringup/vcf-bringup.log I have run these scripts multiple times, and they have completed successfully. Command to make sure the changes to allow a single ESXi can be used for VCF SDDC Manager on the Cloud Builder VM: The script will complete this step. This is the command to run if you want to verify. cat /etc/vmware/vcf/bringup/application.properties Command to restart the vcf-bringup.service on the Cloud Builder VM: The script will complete this step. This is the command to run if you want to run manually. systemctl restart vcf-bringup.service Check out Brock Peterson blogs for example VCF Operations Dashboards to monitor your VCF environments. Best VCF Operations Blog site available! I also have the example code saved in my GitHub Repository In this blog, I used a single Nested ESXi host to keep things simple, and the performance has been fine for a home lab setup. If you want to expand your environment, you can add additional Nested ESXi Hosts. You can either modify the deployment script or manually add more ESXi hosts to the SDDC Manager after the installation to better understand the process. After the VCF SDDC Manager is installed and running, you can safely delete the Cloud Builder from vCenter to free up space and resources.

Prior to reading this blog, I was unaware that the diagnostic data added to VCF Operations could be extracted using the VCF Operations API. This is an excellent read that you should check out before working with the example PowerShell script shared within this blog post.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve received several inquiries from people asking how to extract diagnostic data from VCF Operations since the VMware Skyline service was officially retired (EOL). In the past, VMware Technical Adoption Managers (TAMs) relied on VMware Skyline data to help customers ensure their environments remained up to date with the latest patches. This script could potentially serve as an alternative for extracting diagnostic data from VCF Operations and sharing it with a TAM.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have a VMware TAM but still want to share this data with your internal VMware team, this script will work perfectly for that use case as well. The Excel file generated by this script can also be used to provide your security team with insights into the diagnostic data available within VCF Operations.\nFor automating this script to run on a weekly or daily basis, I recommend using VCF Orchestrator, which is part of VCF Automation.\nI also have the example code saved in my GitHub Repository\nCode Details: Demonstrates how to connect to the VCF Operations API Generates a token for making API requests Creates an Excel spreadsheet to save the events using the importExcel PowerShell module Includes optional code to send the newly created Excel file as an email attachment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 # Import the ImportExcel module (requires prior installation) Import-Module ImportExcel # ----- Configuration and Credentials (Replace with secure methods in production) ----- $opsURL = \u0026#34;https://vao.vcrocs.local\u0026#34;

But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. — George Bernard Shaw\nOut of the box (OOTB), VCF Operations provides many great dashboards. Some questions I frequently get from customers are:\n\u0026ldquo;What else can we monitor with VCF Operations?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I show settings that are most important to my environment?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do other customers use VCF Operations?\u0026rdquo; I always recommend that customers create a list of their (5) favorite dashboards and pin them to the VCF Operations homepage. That way, each morning, as you enjoy your coffee or energy drink, you can get an at-a-glance view of your infrastructure environment.\nWhen designing dashboards, always consider using colors to enhance their functionality—green indicates all is well, while red signals issues that may need attention.\nIn this blog post, I’ll share some screenshots of dashboards that my team or myself have created and used or helped customers implement in their environments. As you review these examples, think about combining sections from different dashboards to create one that covers everything important to you. This way, you’ll have a go-to dashboard you’ll want to check every morning with your favorite wake me up drink in hand.\nThe main goal of this blog post is to provide visual inspiration for what\u0026rsquo;s achievable with Operations Dashboards.\nDashboard Ideas: Environment Configuration Status Counts Mobile Friendly Dashboard Screen Shots: Dashboard: VM Rightsizing\nAlways one of my favorite use cases Shows recommended size for CPU and Memory Include the metrics to show why CPU Count should be increased or decreased Include the metrics to show why Memory Amount should be increased or decreased Dashboard: Environment Overview\nShow Total Inventory Counts Include Alerts that should be reviewed VMware Tools Versions VM OS Hosts Health, Connection State, Power State, Version, Maintenance Mode Status, etc\u0026hellip; Show Host Health in descending order to get you attention Dashboard: Environment Overview\nShow Weather at your data center physical locations Include Health, Maintenance Mode, Workload, Snaps, Etc\u0026hellip; Object Relationship shows what other objects could be affect VM performance\nDashboard: Environment Overview\nDesigned to work on a mobile phone Use Color to get your attention Green is Good Red is Bad Dashboard: Environment Overview\nSame Dashboard as above but on a mobile device. Dashboard: Security Advisories\nThis Dashboard was created in conjunction with a custom Management Pack Builder MP Dashboard: CPU Core Counts\nThis Dashboard makes it easy to show current CPU Core counts to help with licensing Dashboard: vCenters\nThis Dashboard was designed to monitor vCenter appliance VMs only. VMs that are running vCenter. Shows vCenter VM Volumes and Performance Includes vCenter Host details at bottom of Dashboard Dashboard: Virtual Machines\nSimilar to some of the other Dashboards but this one includes some network metrics Example of what I said at beginning of this Blog, add or remove metrics to make the Dashboard work for you Dashboard: Edge Sites\nShow only items that are located in an edge site Use vCenter Tags to specify site location. vCenter Tags make it easy to group together objects. Look at the bottom widget in this Dashboard. In recent versions of Operations, they allow Ancestor/Descendants in views. You can show VM and Host metrics on a single line. That can be very powerful in troubleshooting. Dashboard: vCenter Clusters\nUse TOP-n widgets to show high cpu and memory usage first Set the metrics in the views to use colors to represent high or low values I like how new versions of Operations have the colored squares next to metric values\nDashboard: SaaS Status\nA lot of SaaS products offer a status web site. Use the text display widget to show web site information Lessons Learned: Always think about using colors in your Dashboard Designs I love to use donut charts. You can show a lot of data in a small area of the Dashboard. The text display widget can be used to show data like Weather, Zoom Status, etc\u0026hellip; Links to resources that also show useful Dashboard examples: Brock Peterson Blog Site - Shout out to Brock for some of these examples and ideas.

Links to resources discussed is this Blog Post: VCF Operations for Logs - Official Documentation I created a Google NotebookLM Podcast based on the content of this blog. While it may not be entirely accurate, is any podcast ever 100% perfect, even when real people are speaking? Take a moment to listen and share your thoughts with me!\nvCROCS Deep Dive Podcast | VCF Operations for Logs | How to create URL for Filtering Results\nIn my blogs, I often emphasize that there are multiple methods to achieve the same objective. This article presents just one of the many ways you can tackle this task. I\u0026rsquo;ve shared what I believe to be an effective approach for this particular use case, but keep in mind that every organization and environment varies. There\u0026rsquo;s no definitive right or wrong way to accomplish the tasks discussed in this article.\nAlways test new setups and processes, like those discussed in this blog, in a lab environment before implementing them in a production environment.\nIf you found this blog article helpful and it assisted you, consider buying me a coffee to kickstart my day.\n","date":"2024-10-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://vcrocs.info/vcf-operations-for-logs-how-to-automate-url-generation-for-filtering-results/featured-image_hu_7878a101760145c7.png","permalink":"https://vcrocs.info/vcf-operations-for-logs-how-to-automate-url-generation-for-filtering-results/","title":"VCF Operations for Logs | How to Automate URL Generation for Filtering Results"},{"content":"How to send Automation Script Execution Log Events to VCF Operations for Logs.\nSurround yourself with people that push you to do better. No drama or negativity. Just higher goals and higher motivation. Good times and positive energy. No jealousy or hate. Simply bring out the absolute best in each other. – Warren Buffett\nNote: VCF Operations and Operations for Logs 8.18.0 was used to create this Blog\nI’ve always felt that VCF Operations for Logs deserves more attention, it is a great product. With the Diagnostics Feature (Skyline Replacement) now included in VCF Operations, having VCF Operations for Logs installed (Requirement for Operations Diagnostics Feature) and configured for integration is a game changer. It excites me because now, many of the customers I work with will have access to VCF Operations for Logs in their environment, going beyond just collecting vCenter and ESXi Host logs.\nWhen developing Automation Scripts and processes, I always prioritize execution logging. In the past, I relied on generating text-based log files. However, my latest approach is to route all script logging data directly to VCF Operations for Logs. Once you learn to format the log data in a way that makes it easily searchable, you’ll find yourself wanting to use VCF Operations for Logs for all your logging needs. It transforms log management into an efficient and streamlined process that enhances script visibility and performance monitoring.\nIn this blog, I’ll share some sample script files demonstrating how to send logging information to Log Insight. Sending log data to VCF Operations for Logs via the API is straightforward and requires minimal code. One of the key advantages is that no authentication is needed to send log data, which not only simplifies the scripts but also improves execution speed.\nI’ve also included some sample filter queries that can be used within VCF Operations for Logs. If you’ve read my other blog posts, you’ll know I’m a big fan of creating custom VCF Operations Dashboards to present data in a user-friendly format. My goal is to ensure the data is formatted for quick visibility, allowing you to immediately spot issues that require attention.

Previously, I sent emails with crucial details about new server VM builds to the user initiating the deployment. Now, I’ve shifted to adding this information directly into the Deployment Overview Tab.\nHere are some use cases where adding information to the Deployments Overview Tab is beneficial for new Server VMs:\nLinux VMs: For Linux VMs in my lab, I use Cockpit for a web-based interface to monitor server stats, logs, and more. I include the Cockpit URL in the Overview Tab for easy access. VM Specifications: I often include the CPU, memory, and IP details of the VM as it was initially created. This helps answer common questions about how the VM has changed since it was first provisioned. We’ve all experienced situations where a VM was requested with fewer resources than needed, only for resource adjustments to be requested soon after. Monitoring Links: You can also add links to monitoring tools like VCF Operations. This will not show monitoring data but give you quick access to the application GUI. Additional URLs: Any helpful URLs, like management or configuration portals, can be added to enhance accessibility. Links to the applications only. Note: Keep in mind that the information added to the Deployment Tab cannot be edited later, so avoid including details that may change frequently.\nScreen Shots Screen Shot of the VCF Automation Deployment Overview Tab:\nScreen Shot of the Assembler Template:\nVCF Automation Design Template Example Template Yaml Code:\nTo utilize the Overview Tab, you MUST include \u0026ldquo;formatVersion: 2\u0026rdquo;.

With the introduction of Tiered Memory in ESXi 8.0.3, VMware hasn’t yet integrated tiered memory metrics visibility for VMs using tiered memory into VCF Operations. However, William Lam has provided a Blog outlining the necessary commands to retrieve the tiered memory metrics. Click here to see Blog\nTo build an Operations Management Pack (MP) that captures this data, you need to utilize APIs. In my approach, I used FastAPI to execute a PowerShell Script that connects to vCenter to gather a list of ESXi hosts. The script then establishes an SSH connection to each host, retrieves the VM tiered memory metrics, and sends the results back to FastAPI. These metrics are then made available for Management Pack Builder, allowing you to incorporate the new metrics into the existing VM object within Operations.\nOnce the VM tiered memory metrics are available in Operations, you can create some impressive dashboards to display this information. These dashboards provide a clear, visual representation of how tiered memory is being utilized across your environment, giving you deeper insights and making it easier to monitor and optimize performance.\nUsing a tool like FastAPI to provide additional metrics to Operations opens up a world of possibilities. Once you understand the steps involved, your thought process becomes your most powerful observability tool. This approach empowers you to extend the capabilities of Operations, allowing you to gather and visualize critical metrics that might not be available out of the box.\nTo get started, you’ll need to set up a server with FastAPI installed. In my lab, I created a Rocky Linux 9.4 VM and installed the latest version of FastAPI. Additionally, I installed the latest version of PowerShell along with the VMware PowerCLI and Posh-SSH modules, enabling the necessary functionality for this setup.\nTo create and edit code on my Rocky Linux server, I prefer using the Remote SSH add-in for VSCode, which I have installed on my Apple MacBook. This approach allows me to avoid using the graphical version of Rocky Linux Server, keeping the setup lean and mean. I use PowerShell on Linux servers all the time—I’ve loved it ever since PowerShell became cross-platform.\nWhile working on this blog and sharing links to the discussed resources, I came across another post by William Lam that also explains how to retrieve Host Tiered Memory settings. I adapted William\u0026rsquo;s script to work with MPB and added the new properties to my FastAPI Management Pack. Click here to see Blog\nI encourage you to install the VCF Operations Management Pack Builder appliance and download the MP export file linked at the end of this blog. My goal is for you to understand how Management Packs (MPs) work. While simply using a pre-built MP is easy, taking the time to learn how this MP works will inspire you with new ideas for integrating properties and metrics from other products into your enterprise environment.\nFastAPI The steps I used to install FastAPI on Rocky Linux Server 9.4:\nA very simple process to install FastAPI and get started.

See the sample FastAPI Python code.

MP Builder Details: The following screen shots are all the details I used to create the MP I presented at VMware Explore 2024, and one of the sessions includes a video on MP Builder. I recommend checking it out to get more familiar with MPB. Link to session | CODE1161LV Brock Peterson has a great Blog on building a MP. Link to Blog After building and saving the MP, you need to import into VCF Operations Repository and add account. I show those details in my VMware Explore session video. Lessons learned: Incorporating a FastAPI server adds an additional layer to your observability environment, but the capabilities it unlocks are remarkable. It enables you to gather and serve custom metrics, offering greater flexibility and control over your monitoring and performance analysis. This approach not only enhances visibility but also provides powerful tools to extend the insights available in your environment. Just because products don’t offer APIs out of the box for the metrics you need doesn’t mean you’re limited. You can always leverage custom scripts to gather the data you want. By combining tools like PowerShell, SSH, and FastAPI, you can extract and integrate those custom metrics into your observability platform, giving you the flexibility to get exactly the insights you need.

This year, that thought became a reality. I presented one general session, three {code} theater sessions, and presented or co-presented seven {code} lab sessions. Presenting all day at a technology conference leaves you exhausted by the end of the day!\nOne of my sessions, \u0026lsquo;Maximizing VMware Workstation/Fusion for Business, Education, and Home Labs\u0026rsquo; (CODE1162LV), was highlighted in an article by Virtualization and Cloud Review, and it received positive feedback.\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;One session that I got a lot out of was a VMware Code session entitled \u0026ldquo;Maximizing VMware Workstation/Fusion for Business, Education, and Home Labs\u0026rdquo; [CODE1162LV]. The presenter, Dale Hassinger, VCF Specialist Architect, Broadcom, showed how to work with VMware Workstation using APIs, something that I have never done before but plan on doing so after attending his session.\u0026rdquo; - Virtualization and Cloud Review\nBeing the only session mentioned by name in the Virtualization and Cloud Review article was a proud moment for me as a presenter. We put a lot of time and effort into our presentations, so receiving recognition from a writer for Virtualization and Cloud Review feels really good.\nI enjoy presenting in the {code} Theatre because those sessions were where I learned a lot as a customer, and I want to give back to the {code} community. I also enjoy working with Franky Barragan, the VMware {code} Community Manager. When you talk with Franky, you can hear the passion he has for the {code} community in every conversation. Franky also did an awesome job organizing the Hackathon!\nThis year, I had the opportunity to co-present with a customer, Don Horrox. Don is a systems engineer, and the team he works with has implemented some impressive use cases with the VCF Automation and Operations products. Our session received excellent survey reviews. Don and his teammate, Amos Clerizier, were also part of my Hackathon team. They had a great time and contributed a lot of fantastic ideas. Amos wrote a powerful script that takes RVTools data, de-identifies it, sends it to ChatGPT for prompts, and then re-identifies the data to display the results. One of the judges even referred to this process as HybridAI.\nHackathon The Hackathon was another highlight of the event for me. I served as a team captain, and we finished in 2nd place with our team, \u0026lsquo;RVTools and Ollama\u0026rsquo;. This marks the second year in a row that I\u0026rsquo;ve secured 2nd place as a team captain. Our Hackathon team used a GitHub repository to share ideas, discussions, and code. Click here to see what we were able to \u0026lsquo;hack\u0026rsquo;.\nEvery time I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved in the Hackathon, I\u0026rsquo;ve met people with amazing ideas. After the Hackathon, we usually stay in touch through social media or direct communication. These friendships are ones that will last a lifetime.\nI had the opportunity to meet several of my colleagues in person, which is always a great experience. It was nice to shake hands and personally thank them for all the help they\u0026rsquo;ve provided over the past year. One evening, I had a nice dinner with Cosmin Trif, one of the best co-workers I\u0026rsquo;ve had in my career. He has been helping me since my days as a VMware customer. My whole VCF Specialists Team is an awesome group!\n1:1 meetings with PMs VMware Explore provides VMware customers with the opportunity to talk directly with product managers, and these face-to-face meetings, whether as a customer or an employee, have always been valuable. This year, I attended one of these meetings to discuss VCF operations. During the discussion, the customer got a sneak peek at the VCF 9 UI. They were impressed and had nothing but positive comments about the product\u0026rsquo;s direction.\nVenetian Conference Center The Venetian Conference Center is great because it offers the convenience of having everything under one roof. The rooms are comfortable, and the conference food for breakfast and lunch was particularly good this year. There are also plenty of options for a nice dinner. I had dinner at Delmonico one evening, and as always, the food was excellent.\nMy VMware Explore 2024 Sessions When and Where:\nWebsite: VMware Explore 2024.\nLas Vegas Date: August 26 – 29, 2024\nThe Venetian Convention and Expo Center\nIf you attended my VMware Explore Sessions and want to watch the recordings again, here are the links.

Some attendees traveled 2+ hours to attend. The event brought together professionals from various hospitals and medical institutions.\nThe HVC events have been running since 2011, providing a platform for healthcare IT professionals to connect, learn, and share knowledge. I personally started attending in 2013. An easy way to describe the HVC events for people within the VMware vCommunity, it’s like a VMUG for Healthcare without any sales pitches and the content is driven by the people attending. Healthcare organizations all have similar rules and requirements with their IT infrastructure, so attending the HVC events have been a great way to learn what other people do, share what you do and build vCommunity relationships.\nThis event was particularly significant as it marked the first in-person gathering after a hiatus caused by COVID-19 restrictions and the acquisition of VMware by Broadcom. With these changes behind us, the VMware Healthcare Teams in the area thought it would be a good time to start up the HVC events again. VMware customers ask for these events to be scheduled. They enjoy attending the events to learn from each other.\nWhat I personally witnessed yesterday at the VMware HVC event, was that the culture that surrounds the VMware Products is alive and well.\nHere are my Key Takeaways: A VMware Healthcare Customer took the time out of their busy schedule to tell their story and journey with VCF, that started in 2021. The good and the bad were discussed. I can honestly say that the customers pointed out that there was more positive than negative. One example was upgrades and patching. Far less time spent doing these activities. Engineers spend more time doing Engineering work. Upgrades and patching become more of a monitoring activity. Everyone was shaking hands, hugs, laughing, and just catching up. Attendees engaged in lively discussions, networking, and sharing project updates. The food and drink provided was awesome. The event had zero negativity, reflecting a strong sense of community among the attendees. Personal Highlights: I was able to meet a co-worker that I have known for almost 5 years, in person. Brock Peterson and I are both VCF Aria Specialists. We help VMware Healthcare and Life Sciences customers with Automation, Monitoring and Logging. Brock has been a Role Model/Mentor of mine and it was nice to personally say thanks for all the help he has provided these past couple of years and being a valuable resource for me. If you use the VMware product Aria Operations (vROPS), I can guarantee you have read at least one of the awesome blogs that he has written about the product. The event\u0026rsquo;s organizers, Marcus Roberts and Dan Thomas, deserve special recognition for their hard work in making the event a success. Marcus provided a good conversation at the beginning of the event to give everyone updates and Dan had great fireside chat with the customer discussing their VCF journey, see pic below.

Note that two of the VMware {code} sessions have been combined into consecutive presentations, ensuring that all material is covered in these updated sessions. My journey to this moment began at the Mid-Atlantic HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) events. I initially attended these events as a VMware customer eager to learn.

Typically, in the YAML code of a Aria Automation Design Template, you use either the properties cpuCount and totalMemoryMB or the flavor property. You cannot use both within the same template for the same VM.\nAfter considering the options, I decided to use the cpuCount and totalMemoryMB properties to specify VM CPU and memory, adding logic to the YAML code to determine values based on an input named Flavor.\nFlavor Options:\nSmall: 1 CPU, 2 GB memory Medium: 2 CPUs, 4 GB memory Large: 4 CPUs, 8 GB memory Other: Use CPU and Memory values specified in custom inputs CPU and Memory. See the Full Design Template YAML code below. These two lines of YAML code demonstrate how to specify the cpuCount and totalMemoryMB properties.

Click here to read the blog. Building on those ideas, I now want to demonstrate how to monitor VMware Aria Appliances. Monitoring and observing VMware Aria Appliance VMs is crucial in a VMware environment where many such appliances are present.\nFor VMware Aria Appliances, I created a Custom Group within VMware Aria Operations. These appliances have a property named \u0026ldquo;Summary|Configuration|Product Name\u0026rdquo;. By using a filter that checks if the Product Name contains \u0026ldquo;Aria\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;vRealize\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Log Insight\u0026rdquo;, I was able to group all VMware Aria Appliance VMs together. See Screen Shot below.\nThis filter is applicable to the following Aria Appliances:\nAria Operations Aria Operations for Logs Aria Automation Aria Suite LifeCycle Aria Cloud Proxies Aria Operations for Networks Aria Management Pack Builder vCenter Orchestrator After creating the Custom Group to select only VMware Aria Appliance VMs, I proceeded to build a comprehensive VMware Aria Appliance Monitoring Dashboard. At the top, I included some donut charts (my favorite) to display key metrics such as VMware Aria Appliances Health, Workload, Snapshots, and Uptime in days.\nI have a strong preference against VMs running on snapshots for extended periods, which is why I included a chart for Snapshots. Uptime is also a crucial metric, as it provides insight into a VMs maintenance status. When I see a VM running for hundreds of days, my first thought is that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been patched or upgraded in a while. To ensure the best reliability and access to the latest features, it\u0026rsquo;s important to keep Aria Appliances patched and upgraded regularly.\nSteps to Create the Dashboard Create the (5) Views Show all Aria Appliance VMs with details Show VM Health Show VM Workload Show Snapshot Status Show Uptime (Days) Create the Dashboard To simplify getting started, all the Views and the Dashboard are available in my GitHub repository for download.

A lot of times, people don\u0026rsquo;t know what they want until you show it to them.” - Steve Jobs\nvCenter Observability I was recently asked how to monitor the VM that VMware vCenter runs on using VMware Aria Operations. The main request was to show the disk space used on the volumes to prevent them from filling up. In an environment with over 100 vCenters, I decided to create a view to show all the VMs running vCenter. While Aria Operations allows selecting all vCenters in a view, it does not natively show the VM name that vCenter runs on.\nCreating a Custom Group in Aria Operations to specify the vCenter VMs manually seemed impractical. Initially, I considered using tags in vCenter and creating a Custom Group based on these tags. However, tagging over 100 vCenter VMs and ensuring they are properly tagged would be labor-intensive.\nAfter some thought, I realized that the volume names for vCenter VMs were unique. I created an Aria Operations View to select VMs based on the existence of vCenter volumes. This approach allowed me to add the view to any environment, displaying only the vCenter VMs.\nAfter creating the view to select only vCenter VMs, I aimed to build a comprehensive vCenter Monitoring Dashboard. At the top, I included counts of vCenters, clusters, hosts, and VMs, etc… as these metrics are frequently requested by management. The dashboard features widgets to display all VM volumes (the primary reason for creating the dashboard), vCenter VM performance, CPU/memory history, and a list of vCenters.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to note that in VMware Aria Operations, showing VMware vCenter VMs is different from showing VMware vCenters. When a vCenter is selected in the vCenter Details widget, the dashboard displays host CPU/memory information.\nTo prevent ESXi hosts from being left in maintenance mode accidentally, I added a donut widget to show their status. Additionally, since cluster DRS can sometimes be disabled for changes and forgotten to be re-enabled, another donut widget shows the DRS status.\nSteps to Create the Dashboard Create the (4) Views Select all vCenter VMs Show vCenter Details Show Hosts Maintenance Mode Status Show Clusters DRS Status Create the Dashboard To simplify getting started, all the Views and the Dashboard are available in my GitHub repository for download.

If a VM contains these metrics, it will be selected. These volume names are unique to vCenter VMs, making this approach effective.\nDashboard Screen Shot:\nDashboard Usage:\nStay tuned for future blog posts. I plan to create dashboards for monitoring Aria appliances, similar to what I did for VMware vCenter. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to ensure these appliances are well monitored and maintained, like a Swiss watch.\nUpdate: Link to Aria Appliances Observability Blog\nLinks to resources discussed is this Blog Post: Dale\u0026rsquo;s Github Repository Product Version used for Blog Post: Aria Operations: 8.17.1 Lessons Learned: The relationship between VMware vCenter and the VM it runs on is not available out of the box in VMware Aria Operations.

The first section sets the connection settings: `vcenter`, `username`, and `password`. 2. The `Connect-VIServer` cmdlet connects to your VMware vCenter using the specified credentials. 3. The `Get-VM` cmdlet retrieves a list of all virtual machines in the vCenter. We then use the `Where-Object` cmdlet to filter this list and only include VMs that have at least one snapshot (`$_.HasSnapshot`). 4. We loop through each VM that has a snapshot using a `ForEach-Object` cmdlet, and add its name to an array `$vmsWithSnaps`. 5. The final section exports the array of VM names to a CSV file named `vms-with-snaps.csv` in the `C:\\reports` directory. 6. Finally, we disconnect from the vCenter using the `Disconnect-VIServer` cmdlet.

It is awesome to have the power of AI at your fingertips and not require the power of the internet to use it. Stream Deck and ollama commands together is a great time saver.\nI assign commands I use the most with ollama to buttons. When I have a prompt that works well, assigning the prompt to a stream deck button makes it easy to always run the command the same way. I should call them Prompt Engineering Buttons.

The aspect of the vExpert program I find particularly commendable is its focus on acknowledging individuals for their contributions and dedication to \u0026ldquo;Giving Back\u0026rdquo;. Being chosen for the vExpert program signifies a commitment to sharing knowledge and a desire to elevate not just oneself but also those within the vCommunity.\nAs an employee of Broadcom By VMware, one of my primary ambitions is to contribute more significantly to the vCommunity than I could as a user of VMware products.\nI did more for the vCommunity in 2023 than any previous years.\nVMware Explore 2023 Presentation | Use VMware Aria to Create/Manage/Monitor Windows Servers (on-prem/cloud) [CODE2501LV]\nHackathon Team Captain (Finished in 2nd Place) | VMware Explore 2023\nPhilly VMUG - 2023 | VMware Aria Automation and Operations\nThe PowerShell Podcast | “Using PowerCLI with Dale Hassinger”\nVMware Community Podcast #659\nBlogs: | More Blogs than any previous year\nWhat is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware\u0026rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware\u0026rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware\u0026rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year\u0026rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.\nCriteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term \u0026ldquo;giving back\u0026rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.\nThanks: I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present.

In this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate how to dispatch notifications to both Microsoft Teams and Google Spaces via a Webhook. This technique can be adapted for any messaging service such as Slack, Zoom, Discord, etc., by simply altering the JSON body formatting code and creating a Webhook for message delivery.\nI will guide you through the process of sending alerts from VMware Aria Automation utilizing ABX Actions and Orchestrator Workflows. Though the procedure remains largely the same, there are minor variations in acquiring Property Values. Presenting both methods offers you, the Automation Specialists, the freedom to choose the approach that seamlessly integrates into your workflows. My philosophy in automation is that there are countless ways to achieve the same outcome.\nIn this blog, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the creation of a new virtual machine (VM). At the onset of the build process, I have configured an Extensibility Subscription that triggers the sending of notifications to both Microsoft Teams and Google Spaces. This is accomplished through the use of an ABX Action and an Orchestrator Workflow.\nBesides notifying your team when a new VM is created, I\u0026rsquo;ll demonstrate how to dispatch a message through an Orchestrator Workflow for a Day 2 Automation process.\nCreate a New VM and Send Message Steps:\nWithin the Design section of Aria Automation, create a template. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will construct a straightforward Rocky Linux VM. | Refer to Screen Shot 1. Ensure that all properties you wish to include in your notification are incorporated into the template\u0026rsquo;s YAML code. These property values will be transmitted to both ABX Actions and Orchestrator Workflows. | Refer to Screen Shot 2. You have the flexibility to include any property in your messages, provided it is specified in the template\u0026rsquo;s YAML code. Proceed to set up an Extensibility Action. | See Screen Shot 3 and Screen Shot 4. Establish an Extensibility Subscription that will initiate the ABX Action or Orchestrator Workflow as required. | Refer to Screen Shot 5. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of how to define a subscription. | See Screen Shot 6. Initiate the creation of an Orchestrator Workflow. | Refer to Screen Shot 7. Incorporate an input property into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See Screen Shot 8. Outline the schema within the Orchestrator Workflow. | Refer to Screen Shot 9. Inject the necessary code into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See Screen Shot 10 and Screen Shot 11. Deploy a new VM and confirm that the Extensibility Subscription successfully triggered the ABX Action you defined. Check your preferred messaging system to ensure the notification was received. Example of a Google Spaces Message | Refer to Screen Shot 12. Example of a Microsoft Teams Message | See Screen Shot 13. If all steps were executed successfully, it\u0026rsquo;s time for a celebration! Screen Shot 14 illustrates the process of creating a Google Spaces Webhook. Orchestrator Workflow Day 2 Automation and Send Message Steps:\nInitiate the creation of an Orchestrator Workflow. Creating a new Workflow is the same for Day 2 Automation Processes as when a Workflow was created for building a New VM. | Refer to Screen Shot 7. Incorporate an input property into the Orchestrator Workflow for every question needed to complete the Day 2 Automation. | See Screen Shot 15. Inject the necessary code into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See Screen Shot 16. Run the Workflow and confirm that the code successfully ran and created the message . Check your preferred messaging system to ensure the notification was received. The Messages with look the same as when you created a New VM. YOU define what information is shown. Example of a Google Spaces Message | Refer to Screen Shot 12. Example of a Microsoft Teams Message | See Screen Shot 13. If all steps were executed successfully, it\u0026rsquo;s time for a high five! Example of a Day 2 Automation Microsoft Teams Message | See Screen Shot 17.

There were some articles saying that people just getting into IT Technology roles will now not be able to learn about VMware Products. This is NOT True and I wanted to share some examples of how people can still learn about Virtualization with VMware Products in a Home Lab environment.\nI have been in the IT Industry for many years and there is a quote that I use all the time for people that want to advance their IT skills. \u0026ldquo;9 - 5 pay the bills but 5 - 10 advances your career\u0026rdquo;.\nThere are still many options to learn about VMware Products. Here are some items that can be used to advance your knowledge:\nVMware Workstation | Link to Workstation Download site VMware Fusion | Link to Fusion Download site VMware ESXi Link to vSphere Download site Vmware ESXi ARM Edition | Link to Documentation You also don\u0026rsquo;t need to have the newest, fastest, most advanced hardware if you just want to learn about the VMware Products. The hardware I have to create this Blog Post is an older Apple MacBook Pro that is no longer supported and will not run the latest versions of MAC OS. I installed Ubuntu Desktop on this Apple Laptop and then installed VMware Workstation. This setup is OK for learning and testing. I have a Raspberry PI 4 with 8 GB memory to install ESXi ARM Edition.\nItems to know when setting up a Home Lab environment:\nVMware ESXi | Default Evaluation period is 60 days. This will enable you to have a full featured host to test anything you want to learn for 60 days. VMware Workstation | Non-Commercial use is free to use VMware Fusion | Non-Commercial use is free to use Vmware ESXi ARM Edition | Default Evaluation period is 180 days To get access to additional VMware Software, Take a look at VMUG Advantage:\nLink to VMUG Advantage You do have to purchase VMUG Advantage. If you attend a local VMUG event, you will often get coupons for a discount to purchase VMUG Advantage. This is one of the best vCommunity Programs you can join and it will include licenses for many of the VMware solutions which are valid for a year.

Whenever I sought an in-depth understanding of Aria Operations, Steve would arrange a session with Brock. These interactions left me aspiring for a similar position at VMware. My contributions to VMware included participating in customer reference calls, where I eagerly shared my expertise in the Aria Suite with Healthcare Organizations, aiding them in embarking on their journey in Automation, Monitoring, or Logging. Eventually, I secured a role at VMware, allowing me to collaborate daily with Brock and the incredible VMware Cloud Foundation Specialists team, focusing on Automation, Monitoring, and Logging. The camaraderie and collective expertise of this team is truly remarkable. Working within a team that boasts a variety of role models is an great experience.\nThe blog post begins with an intriguing scenario where Brock, responding to a customer\u0026rsquo;s query about launching the VMRC client to display a VM\u0026rsquo;s console within Aria Operations (a functionality not native to the product), highlighted the collaborative spirit of the team. Having previously created a similar dashboard as a customer, I offered to replicate it in my lab area for Brock, emphasizing the team\u0026rsquo;s culture of sharing existing solutions and code. Brock liked what I created in my lab and suggested that we share this knowledge with the vCommunity by creating a Blog, recognizing the potential interest from other customers in implementing such a solution. This shows the team\u0026rsquo;s commitment to collaboration and knowledge sharing.\nPlease explore the blog post to witness the exceptional outcomes a great team can achieve.

When new versions of VMware Aria Operations are released, the code or process may need to be changed.\nI was recently asked how to create a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard that groups VMs together by vCenter TAGs. IE: If there is 100 VMs in vCenter that have a TAG Named \u0026ldquo;Servers-DB\u0026rdquo;, they wanted to see the CPU, Memory, Disk Space, and Critical Alerts Totals for all VMs with that vCenter TAG. They have many vCenter TAGs and each TAG would be on a single line with only Total Values shown.\nSee the screenshot that shows the final Dashboard Design.\nDashboard Design The left side of the Dashboard shows all the Custom Groups that were created based on vCenter TAGs. The values shown on each row are the Metric Totals for all VMs that have the same vCenter TAG. The left side is a View so that all the data can be exported as a CSV file. The right side of the Dashboard is a view that shows the VM details. The right side is optional. I added the right side to show that the Super Metrics were calculating the metric totals correct. Each metric shown requires a Super Metric to Sum the values within the Custom Group. Each row shown requires a Custom Group to define which vCenter TAG to use. Watch the videos below to see the details on how to create this Dashboard. Screen Shot of Dashboard To group VMs together in VMware Aria Operations based on vCenter TAGs, you use Custom Groups. Custom Groups have a group type. I created (2) new Group Types for this Dashboard. I named one Group Type \u0026ldquo;Applications\u0026rdquo; and one Group Type \u0026ldquo;All-APPs\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;All-APPs\u0026rdquo; is the Parent Group and \u0026ldquo;Applications\u0026rdquo; is the child group.\nWatch video to see how to define VMware Aria Operations Custom Group membership based on a vCenter TAG Name:\nTo show the Metric Totals of each Custom Group, we created Super Metrics to sum the value of all the VMs within the Custom Group. If you were only using one vCenter TAG and one Custom Group, you would not need to do this. We wanted to show the Metric Values of a 100+ vCenter TAGs and each vCenter TAG would be on a separate line. That is why we created the Super Metrics.\nWatch video to see how to create VMware Aria Operations Super Metrics to total Virtual Machine Metrics:\nTo show all the Custom Groups names and Super Metric values we created a View. Main reason to create the View was to be able to export the data as a CSV file.\nWatch video to see how to create VMware Aria Operations View that shows the Custom Groups with VM metric totals:\nLessons Learned and acknowledgements: Thank You to Brock Peterson on providing input on how to get metric value totals by using Super Metrics. Thank You to my customer for the challenging question. I did not create a Dashboard like this before. I am glad we were able to create a Dashboard that answered your request and I am able to share the technique with the vCommunity. You CAN group VMs in VMware Aria Operations together by using vCenter TAGs and total the Metric Values on a single line within a List View.

When new versions of VMware Aria Automation are released, the code or process may need to be changed.\nAll the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code.\nVMware Aria Automation Orchestrator Actions are a very powerful way to add checks into your server build process. This Blog Post shows you how to verify that the AD OU structure is in place before you do a new Server Build. Within the VMware Aria Automation Catalog, you can have custom forms to ask all the questions required to build a new server (see screen shot). One of the questions can be which AD OU you want to create the new Windows Server. The list of existing OUs in AD can be a dropdown with all the AD OU names provided by a Action. After you select the OU name to locate the new Windows Server Build, the next Action can verify that all the AD Sub OUs are in place. If the OUs are in place the action will only verify. If an AD OU is missing, the Action will create the AD OU before you press submit to create new Server.\nWatch this video to see the complete process that is discussed in this Blog Post.\nHere is Javascript code for the Action that returns all existing AD OUs to populate the dropdown on the custom form.

We received good feedback from the attendees on the capabilities of the MP.\nVMware Aria Operations VMware Aria Operations 8.14.1 and Servicenow MP (Management Pack) 9.0 was used for this Blog Post. When new versions of VMware Aria Operations or the MP are released, the code or process may need to be changed.\nAll the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code.\nI wanted to share how I setup the Servicenow Management Pack in my lab to update a Servicenow CMDB (Configuration Management DataBase). The VMware Documentation covers the process well. I wanted to cover a couple of steps to help make the process easier.\nI followed the instructions exactly as listed in the PDF link below.\nInstructions to setup Servicenow to allow the MP to send data to CMDB | Click Here to View PDF\nFor the Servicenow user permissions I did the following:\nCreated a Servicenow user named LPU (Least Privilege User) Created a Servicenow Role and named it vROPS_MP Added the user to the role. Added the role to all the Servicenow ACLs listed in the document. If there were more than one ACL with the same name with read permissions, I used the newest ACL. I did not add to all ACLs with the same name. I gave the role “read” and “edit_ci_relations” to the tables listed in the document. I used the moid_populate_only.json config that is OOTB (Out of the Box) with no changes to start to make sure everything was working correct. When I added the account to the management pack in Aria Operations, it did a good job to let me know if everything was set up correctly in Servicenow and if the json config file was setup correct. I had a permission wrong and it showed me what was wrong when I did a Validate Connection. I fixed the permission like it showed me and then everything worked. My lab data is now showing up in Servicenow CMDB.\nManagement Pack Config screen: Management Pack Config screen (Validate Connection | Failed). Shows the field name is incorrect: Management Pack Config screen (Validate Connection | Success): OOTB, the config files can be found here on the VMware Aria Operations Appliance:\nThe config file will go here: /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/user/plugins/inbound/servicenow_adapter3/work\nThe templates are located at: /usr/lib/vmware-vcops/user/plugins/inbound/servicenow_adapter3/conf/config_samples\nHere is the moid_populate_only.json with no changes.\nClick arrow to expand the code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { \u0026#34;cmdbSync\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;syncMode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;POPULATE_ONLY\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;objectIdentifierSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MOID\u0026#34; } } After I verified everything was working with OOTB settings, I wanted to add some additional data to the Servicenow CMDB.

When new versions of VMware Aria Automation are released, the code may need to be changed.\nAll the source code for this Blog is saved in my GitHub Repository. Click on the links within the blog to access the code.\nI wanted to share how I use Action Constants and Secrets within VMware Aria Automation. Action Constants are a great to have a variable that can be used with many Actions where the value may change. Instead of having to edit 10s or 100s of Actions, you change One Action Constant and all the Actions are updated instantly. Main reason to use Secrets is to keep the values of Passwords out of the code! Plus, like Action Constants, if a Password would change, all you need to do is change one Secret and all your Actions and Templates are automatically Updated. Secrets can also be used in the yaml code of Templates.\nAction Constants Action Constants Use Cases:\nvCenter Username vCenter FQDN VMware Aria Automation Config Username VMware Aria Automation Config FQDN salt master FQDN Any value used in Actions that may change from time to time To access Action Constants: Assembler/Extensibility/Actions/Actions Constants\nYou will see the Action Constants Names and Values. How to use Action Constants and Secrets with an Action:\nAdd the Action Constants and Secrets used within the Action in the Default inputs section. To use a Action Constant value within the Action PowerShell code use $inputs.\u0026ldquo;Action Constant\u0026rdquo; To use a Secret value within the Action PowerShell code use $context.getSecret($inputs.\u0026ldquo;Secret Name\u0026rdquo;) In the example code, review how I am connecting to the vCenter. No hard coded Username, Password or vCenter FQDN. If any of these values would change, I would never need to edit the Action, only the Action Constants and Secret. Link to code | GitHub Repository Secrets Secrets Use Cases:\nPasswords Any value you don\u0026rsquo;t want displayed in plain text within your code To access Secrets: Assembler/Infrastructure/Secrets/Secrets\nYou will see the Secret Names and Description only. You can never see the Secret value after you create it. If you think the value is not correct you need to re-enter the value. How to use Secrets with an Template:\nAdd code to the template yaml that is like this: password: \u0026lsquo;${secret.UbuntuPassword}\u0026rsquo; See Screen Shot Links to resources about Actions Constants and Secrets: Secret Automation Assembler properties How can I create extensibility action constants When I write my blogs, I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task.

New VMware Aria Operations for Logs updates are released every month, so the details shown in this Blog Post could change.\nWhen you use VMware Aria Operations for Logs | SaaS Version, you need to have one or more Cloud Proxies to send the log info from your on-prem vCenter and ESXi Hosts to VMware Cloud Services. If you have more than (1) Cloud Proxy, there is no automated way built into VMware Aria Operations for Logs to distribute the Cloud Proxy usage. One way to set the vCenter ESXi hosts to use a specific Cloud Proxy, is to use a PowerCLI script. I included some sample scripts in this blog post to help you get started.\nLogic of the PowerCLI script:\nThe script will count the number of VMware Cloud Services, Cloud Proxies Specified The script will count the number of VMware vCenter ESXi Hosts in the vCenter Specified The script will equally distribute the number of vCenter ESXi Hosts per Cloud Proxy The script will set the Advanced System Setting \u0026ldquo;Syslog.global.logHost\u0026rdquo; on each ESXi Host ESXi Host Advanced System Settings:\nThis is how to manually set the \u0026ldquo;Syslog.global.logHost\u0026rdquo; on each ESXi Host Cloud Proxies:\nGo to Configuration/Cloud Proxies to see all the Proxies added Cloud Proxy Information:\nCloud Proxy Details like State, CPU, Memory vSphere Integration:\nGo to Configuration/vSphere Integration to see all the vCenters added vCenter Server Configuration:\nvCenter Server Configuration You can use this screen to set which Cloud Proxy to use but if you have 100s or 1000s of Hosts, I find it easier to use the script included in this Blog Post.

This change allows you to create a Job to run everyday that will delete all Snaps on VMs EXCEPT Snaps that have \u0026ldquo;DoNotDelete\u0026rdquo; in the name.\nYou could also do the opposite with this process. You can have the job only delete Snapshots where the Snap Name contains the text \u0026ldquo;AutoDelete\u0026rdquo;. I prefer using the method to auto delete all old VM snaps, unless you tell me not to. After being a VMware administrator for many years, I have seen to many VMs running with snaps older that 30 days or even with multiple snaps running and each snap 60+ days old. That is NOT best practice. VM Snaps are NOT Backups. Using Automation Central within VMware Aria Operations helps you keep your environment running better and helps you follow some best practice rules.\nSchedule, Report, History amd Jobs Here are the screens you will see in Automation Central, Schedule, Report, History amd Jobs.\nSchedule: Nice calendar view of all scheduled jobs. Report: Shows you how much storage you were able to re-claim by deleting old snaps. History: Shows you every time a Snap was deleted with details. Jobs: List of all Jobs you created. Lessons Learned Using the VMware Aria Operations Automation Central is a great way to keep snapshots cleaned up on VMs. Add the text \u0026ldquo;DoNotDelete\u0026rdquo; to the Snap Name, makes an easy way to save Snaps that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be auto deleted.

Hopefully you will learn from my Tips and Tricks.\nVMware Aria Operations 8.12 Released: With the release of VMware Aria Operations 8.12, Metric Searches was added to the product.\nI always like to create Dashboards with VMware Aria Operations to show metric information that I think is important to a VMware Admin. I think that metric searches will help provide a lot of information that is not included on existing or custom dashboards. Metric Searches will also allow non-admins, that don\u0026rsquo;t have permission to create dashboards and views, to see specific information to help troubleshoot an issue.\nI really like how the results of a metric search will stack and then you can scroll to see what item has the highest value. You can change the results to show different time ranges. After results are displayed you can also start defining the parents of the results.\nSearch Examples: In this example the metric search found all VMs with CPU|Ready ms \u0026gt; 750 ms.

RVTools was #1 on the VMware Tools list on vSpeaking Podcast Episode 108. When I was a VMware Customer, I used RVTools for 10+ years.\nRecently I was asked how to see some of the data that RVTools generates in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. Some of the data displayed in the RVTools vHealth Worksheet is not a metric or property that VMware Aria Operations collects or generates. The company uses VMware Aria Operations for all monitoring and thought it would be nice to see this additional data in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. They would auto generate the RVTools files everyday, but it was additional steps to open the generated spreadsheet file, plus they had to remember to go look at the RVTools data. If the RVTools data was in a Dashboard, they thought it would be easier to see and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to remember to go look at the data. They would make the RVTools Dashboard a favorite in VMware Aria Operations and look at the data everyday.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use RVTools today, take some time and review it. There are some good use cases for using the product. Awesome to see a Product developed by a VMware admin to make his life easier, and then shared and used by over a million people within the vCommunity.\nUse Case Customer used RVTools to see data about their VMware environment. Customer used VMware Aria Operations for all monitoring. Customer wanted to have a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard that showed RVTools data to create a \u0026ldquo;Single Pane of Glass\u0026rdquo; experience. Steps to complete the process: Automate the process to generate the RVTools xlsx file everyday. Generate html files from the RVTools xlsx file, to display in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard. Need access to a Web Server of your choice to save the html files. The files are static, so any flavor of web server will work. RVTools vHealth data in a VMware Aria Operations Dashboard: Screen shot of Dashboard PowerShell Script: The script was created to be dynamic. No worksheet names or field names are hard coded. If new Worksheets or fields are added to RVTools in the future, they will automatically be picked up with this script.\nRVTools provides a program to encrypt your password that will be used with the script. The program is named \u0026ldquo;RVToolsPasswordEncryption.exe\u0026rdquo;.\nThe PowerShell Script uses the importexcel PowerShell Module to see the data in the RVTools xlsx file. If you have never used the importexcel module, please review to see if you would have other use cases. No need to have Excel Installed. Works Awesome, one of my Favorite PowerShell Modules.

This scenario is common across the VMware stack of products as it’s not practical to have a button for everything, but it usually leads to the follow up question in some form of “well how do I call that?”. I wanted to write about a recent experience with a colleague as a means of showing one way to accomplish that.\nBefore I jump into the details, I wanted to add somewhat of a disclaimer that with any type of automation there are numerous ways to solve a particular problem. Based on my comfort with specific products and scripting languages, what’s below is how I was able to work with the client to address the problem. There is the possibility that another person could accomplish the same task in a different way and none of it is ‘wrong’.\nA colleague came to me and asked about a way to assist a client looking to add several networks into a Network Profile within Cloud Assembly (a component of Aria Automation). While his client could have very easily clicked one-by-one in the UI, that is a tedious operation and runs the risk of human error. Based on the client’s familiarity with PowerShell, we opted to write a script to invoke the necessary API’s using the Invoke-RestMethod PowerShell cmdlet.\nSo, to frame up a bit more of the ‘how’, when faced with a scenario like this, we need to have a script that performs three steps:\nSteps: Get your authentication token/header configured Find the appropriate URI and use a ‘GET’ method to look at the formatting and to help build a body Find the appropriate URI and method (e.g. ‘PATCH’ or ‘POST’) in order to call that API and feed it the necessary information in the body Step 1: So, I need to provide a set of credentials to the CSP login URI. This will give me a refresh token which I can then feed to the IaaS login URI to get my access token. The access token will be what I can use to make the necessary calls into my Aria Automation environment. The URI’s and some more detail are provided in VMware KB 89129.\nThere are some potentially easier methods to authenticate to Aria Automation and invoke a REST API call (like the PowerVRA Module), but for my example below, I used all native PowerShell.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 #BasicInfo: $vraServer = \u0026#34;vra.corp.local\u0026#34; #Get Credentials to build auth: $credential = Get-Credential $username = $credential.UserName $pass = $credential.Password $password = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($pass)) $authBody = @{ \u0026#34;username\u0026#34; = $username \u0026#34;password\u0026#34; = $password } #Build Header: $header = New-Object \u0026#34;System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[[String],[String]]\u0026#34; $header.Add(\u0026#34;Accept\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;) $header.Add(\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;) #Get Refresh Token: $uri = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + $vraServer + \u0026#34;/csp/gateway/am/api/login?access_token\u0026#34; $refreshToken = Invoke-RestMethod -uri $uri -Method POST -Headers $header -Body ($authBody | ConvertTo-Json) -SkipCertificateCheck $refreshToken = $refreshToken.refresh_token $refreshTokenBody = @{ \u0026#34;refreshToken\u0026#34; = $refreshToken } #Get Access Token: $uri = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + $vraServer + \u0026#34;/iaas/api/login\u0026#34; $accessToken = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method POST -Headers $header -body ($refreshTokenBody | ConvertTo-JSON) -SkipCertificateCheck $accessToken = \u0026#34;Bearer \u0026#34; + $accessToken.token #add access token to Header $header.Add(\u0026#34;Authorization\u0026#34;,$accessToken) Step 2: Now that I have the $accessToken variable set and added to my header, I can make any REST API calls I need. For this example, we wanted to add a bunch of fabric-networks (in vSphere parlance DvPGs) to a network profile. In VMware Aria Automation, these are already available with the addition of my vCenter Cloud Account, just not associated with a network profile. In order to enumerate the available fabric-networks, I am going to take my $header variable with the newly generated $accessToken added and call a ‘Get’ against the /iaas/api/fabric-networks/ URI.\n1 2 3 #Get Fabric Network Ids: $uri = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + $vraServer + \u0026#34;/iaas/api/fabric-networks\u0026#34; $fabricNetworks = Invoke-RestMethod -uri $uri -Method GET -Headers $header - Now that I have a full list, I wanted to isolate the list down to those on a specific Distributed Virtual Switch using the following:\n1 $dvPGs = $fabricNetworks.content | Where {$_.name -like \u0026#39;*DvPG*\u0026#39;} Step 3: Now that I have my list of fabric-networks, I wanted to build a JSON body that I could send to Aria Automation to add them to the network-profile in question. So, I used the following request to pull the necessary info:\n1 2 3 #Get Network Profiles: $uri = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + $vraServer + \u0026#34;/iaas/api/network-profiles\u0026#34; $networkProfiles = Invoke-RestMethod -uri $uri -Method GET -Headers $header -SkipCertificateCheck In my lab I had a single network profile, so if I just run $networkProfiles | ConvertTo-JSON in PowerShell, we get the info we need for our body.\nThe fun with this specific example is that the info in the ‘GET’ request is slightly different than how we have to format it for the ‘PATCH’ request. Looking at the SwaggerUI interface (https://\u0026ldquo;YourAriaAutomationServer\u0026rdquo;/iaas/api/swagger) and looking at the Network Profile Section, I can see the URI for the PATCH call (/iaas/api/network-profiles/{id}) and that we need to feed an array of ID’s to a property called ‘fabricNetworkIds’. A couple of other good points to call out is to pay attention to any field or property marked as ‘Required’. If you’re unfamiliar with the SwaggerUI interface, selecting the ‘Model’ link within a Specific URI will give you that information. In my example, I see I need to have the ID for the network profile, the name of the network profile, and the regionID of the network profile.\n(Side note… depending on what is in the REST Body, exercise some caution and testing with a PATCH or PUT command as in this specific case with the NetworkID’s, they will only add what is in the body and remove anything else. Essentially the body replaces what is already there instead of appending to an already existing list.)\nNow that I have my body, we just repeat the process and invoke the call to the appropriate URI. The example below only has a couple of fabricNetworkIds specified, but the actual ask was for several hundred.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 $body = @{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;REST_API\u0026#34; \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;= \u0026#34;cce57ddd-d206-9999-870d-25b8775fb365\u0026#34; \u0026#34;orgId\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;12131928-3bdd-9999-9e69-3edf5c318a7d\u0026#34; \u0026#34;customProperties\u0026#34; = @{ \u0026#34;datacenterId\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;Datacenter:datacenter-3\u0026#34; } \u0026#34;externalRegionId\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;Datacenter:datacenter-3\u0026#34; \u0026#34;cloudAccountId\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;8274acb1-bad2-40cf-1969-e3ed60c16956\u0026#34; \u0026#34;isolationType\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;NONE\u0026#34; \u0026#34;fabricNetworkIds\u0026#34; = @( \u0026#34;fba96959-c0b2-99a6-bb7b-0da4c35b3eaf\u0026#34; \u0026#34;21a52412-85a3-4b9d-a99b-0aaf19185755\u0026#34; ) } $uri = \u0026#34;https://\u0026#34; + $vraServer + \u0026#34;/iaas/api/network-profiles/\u0026#34; + $npId Invoke-RestMethod -uri $uri -Method PATCH -Headers $header -Body ($body | ConvertTo-JSON -Depth 5) -SkipCertificateCheck The result is beneficial for two reasons.\nMy colleague and his client have a way of adding the necessary DvPG’s to their network profile in a methodical way that avoids a lot of clicking. The steps and much of the code above are reusable, so whatever the use case you’re attempting to solve for, you don’t have to start from scratch each time. Hopefully this example helps anyone who is stuck or just looking for an example to keep in their back pocket of ‘how to’ for when that situation arises.\nGuest Blogger: I want to thank guest Blogger, Dave Kaber @dave_kaber, for taking the time to write this blog post and share with the #vCommunity.

This past year, I started listening to a new podcast, \u0026ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast\u0026rdquo;. This podcast has become one of my favorites that I listen to every week. The hosts (Andrew Pla and Jordan Hammond) are funny, the content interests me a lot, and the list of guests has been awesome. The guests are people that I have read their books or use their PowerShell Modules to complete automation.\nI thought it would be fun to join the podcast as a guest, to share how I use PowerShell with VMware products. VMware has a PowerShell Module, PowerCLI, that I use with almost all automation that I create. With VMware Aria Automation, you can use PowerShell with Workflows, Actions, and have salt execute PowerShell scripts with state files and functions. So I reached out to the hosts of \u0026ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast\u0026rdquo; and showed my interest to be a guest on the Podcast. They thought that my story would make a good episode, so we scheduled a time to record. The experience to record the podcast episode was great. The behind the scenes was funny. The guests talk to each other the same way they do when when recording an episode. They make you feel comfortable as a guest.\nHopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.\nThe episode I recorded with \u0026ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast\u0026rdquo; was released on 03/20/2023.

One item when building new Windows Servers is adding drives. I want a way to add additional drives and have the drive be online and formatted properly. Non SQL Windows Servers will have data drives formatted with 4k allocation unit size and Windows SQL Servers will have the data drives formatted with 64k allocation unit size. VMware Aria Automation provides a way to add drives OOTB (Out of the Box) but does not automatically format the drives. That is why I use a Salt state in my example. I use the salt state to bring the new drive online and format. This Blog post shows one way to accomplish these tasks. I always say, with automation there a 100 ways to do the same process. Hopefully this Blog gives you some ideas and options.\nUse Case Add Cloud Agnostic Volumes to a VMware Aria Automation Cloud Template. To make New Windows Server Builds consistent I show the drives that are available on the Catalog Item Custom Form. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to add any additional drives. Keep the drive sizes at the default size of \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; and the drives DO NOT get created. At the end of the new server build I want the new Windows Server drives to be online and formatted properly. Be production ready! Steps to complete the process: Automated Salt minion installation. See the Blog Post I wrote that completes this step. Click Here Add grains data about the drives to minion when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. Run a state file when the minion installation completes that brings the new drive online and formats the drive so that it is ready to use immediately. See example yaml code. Requirements: This blog was created using VMware Aria Automation and VMware Aria Automation Config version 8.11.0 (Salt version 3005.1). The process may vary for different versions of VMware Aria Automation and Salt. Cloud Template | Windows 2019 Server: There are (3) Cloud Agnostic Volumes on the Cloud Template for my use case. You can have as many as you want for your environment. The SaltStack Config Resource is added to the Cloud Template. VMware Aria Automation Cloud Template file: Key elements to review in the yaml code: The yaml code includes grains that saves the drive information. These values are based on input from the Catalog custom form. the yaml code includes stateFiles to run. If the drive size input specified is equal to \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; then the drive count will be \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo;. Drive will NOT be created.

Lessons Learned Saving information as grains data is a great way to save input data when creating new servers. The combination of having Salt State files run PowerShell scripts is very powerful when creating new Windows Servers with VMware Aria Automation. When I write about VMware Aria Automation, I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. VMware Aria Automation Config is the same way. I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization/environment will be different. There is no right or wrong way to use Salt. This is a GREAT Tool that is included with your VMware Aria Suite Advanced/Enterprise license. If you own the VMware Aria Suite, you own VMware Aria Automation Config.\nVMware Aria Automation = vRealize Automation VMware Aria Automation Config = SaltStack Config If you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

The first process to use salt with new servers is to install the salt minion, which is an agent that needs installed on the Server. There are many different ways to install the salt minion agent and what I wanted to show in this blog post is how to use the SaltStack Config Resource with the VMware Automation Cloud Template. When creating a Cloud Template in VMware Aria Automation, one of the options is to add the SaltStack Config Resource.\nWhat the SaltStack Config Resource provides:\nAutomated Salt minion installation Ability to add grains data to minion when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. The minion key is auto-accepted in SaltStack Config If you delete the VM deployment in VMware Aria Automation, the minion key will be automatically removed from VMware Aria Automation Config. Built-in decommission. Ability to run a state file when the minion installation completes. See example yaml code. Requirements:\nThis blog was created using VMware Aria Automation version 8.11.0. The process may vary for different version of VMware Aria Automation. TCP Port 445 needs to be open between VMware Aria Automation Config server and the new Server that the minion is being installed on. Check the VMware Aria Automation Config server. The OS that you are using for the new server must have an agent file in the /etc/salt/cloud.deploy.d folder. Check the VMware Aria Automation Config server. The version of the agent files in the /etc/salt/cloud.deploy.d folder must match the version of the salt master. The script that creates the grains file when using the SaltStack Config Resource and VMware Aria cloud templates with Windows Servers needs to be manually replaced on the VMware Aria Automation Config Server (salt master). Future VMware Aria Automation Config installs with LCM (VMware Aria Suite LifeCycle) will include this fix. The script creates the grains file in the incorrect folder. Location of script on salt master: /lib64/python3.7/site-packages/salt/utils/cloud.py Make a copy of the original cloud.py before replacing with updated version. Where to get new script: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/master/salt/utils/cloud.py The grains file will be created in \u0026ldquo;C:\\ProgramData\\Salt Project\\Salt\\conf\u0026rdquo; after the script is updated. Update: When I installed VMware Aria Automation Config 8.12, 8.13 and 8.14 I still needed to update the cloud.py file for the grains to be created properly.

I like using vCenter TAGs for specifying details about VMs, so I thought I would use VMware vCenter TAGs to specify which DataStore Cluster to place a VM.\nI looked at using a Configuration management tool like salt but one of the requirements was to make it easy for the VMware Admin to specify and maintain VM DataStore placement within the VMware vCenter UI.\nI have included sample code that will:\nCreate a VMware vCenter TAG Category Create a VMware vCenter TAG based on DataStore Cluster Name Add the DataStore Cluster VMware vCenter TAG to all VMs within a DataStore cluster Verify that each VM has only (1) vCenter DataStore Cluster TAG Verify that the VM is in the correct DataStore Cluster.

You could change code slightly and specify a specific DataStore. If there is a member on your VMware Team that changes which DataStore Cluster a VM should be located for no reason, you could also fix the issue by giving that Team Member 30 days in the electric chair so they don\u0026rsquo;t do it again. :) When I write about vRealize Aria Automation, I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task.

If you look at some of my previous blog posts I wrote about SaltStack Config a lot. I thought this would be a good time for myself to learn Ansible and compare the two products.\nWhen I started reading about the VMware Aria Automation and Ansible Integration, I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a single blog post or article that covered everything from installing Ansible to creating a new Server Build in Aria Automation.

Within a month of my hire date VMware announced VMware Aria. So now I am a TAM with a focus on the VMware Aria Product.\nTo work for VMware was a career goal of mine. I was always impressed by the VMware employees that I worked with the past 10+ years. Everyone was always very professional and had a great attitude to help their customers. I wanted to know personally what it was like to work in that type of culture. If you know me you know that I have a passion for the VMware Aria suite of Products. So to be a TAM with a focus on Aria is a good fit for me.\nAfter several months at VMware, this is what I learned.\nThe culture overall is very positive. A lot of people helped me in my on-boarding and wanted to see me be successful. People that I knew before I joined VMware reached out to me and said \u0026ldquo;What can I do to help you\u0026rdquo;. The employee benefits are the best that I ever had in my career so far. You get to do a lot of training to keep your skills up to date and at a level the customers expect. The on-boarding process can take days, weeks, months\u0026hellip; To get started I received a laptop of my choice 3 days before my start date. Never experienced that before. Having a Mentor at VMware is very important. Someone that wants to help you be successful and will take the time to show you how to do your job, recommend training, help you pick benefits, let you know about different programs to get involved with, let you know about weekly zoom training sessions, help you get a lab setup, etc\u0026hellip; VMware wants all employees to give back by making donations to non-profits, 100% match by VMware. VMware wants all employees to donate time to non-profits. Special thanks to some people that went above and beyond when I started at VMware to help me, in no particular order:\nMarshall Cline, Ariel Sanchez, Brock Peterson, Cosmin Trif, Christopher Kusek, Anton Wesztergom, Alex Musicante, Chad Thomas, David Kruse, Steve Lieberson, Paul Schlosser, Christina Griffus and some I may have missed.\nNow that I am getting more engaged with the customers that I will be working with, I plan to start blogging more again to continue giving back to the vCommunity. Share the knowledge!\nIf anyone that reads my blogs would ever want to talk to me about being a VMware employee, please reach out to me. I will share my experience 1:1.\nAnother area that I want to give back to the vCommunity is to help Mentor others.

I attended a lot of sessions. See list of sessions that I would enjoy. I would do Hands on Labs that were not available to do anytime. There are some HOLs that are available only during the conference and there are VMware people to help you with the labs. If you are a TAM customer, there are sessions dedicated to TAM customers. Go to the Expo Area. You can always talk to VMware Engineers at the booths in the Expo Area and watch demos. A lot of Vendors in the Expo Area. I would allows attend some of the vBrownbag Tech Talks. The Tech Talks were a 10 - 15 minute presentation. Watch for Vendor Parties. They are always fun and drinks | food are always free. The Veeam party in the past was always one of the better parties.

As a Windows Admin most of my automation was done with PowerShell. All the examples you see in the salt documentation are written in Python, so to use Python for some processes makes sense.\nI had a use case that made sense to use Python. I want to schedule reboots of AWS EC2 instances using SaltStack Config. For Servers that are on-prem I would always automate the process to create a server reboot scheduled task in vCenter. With AWS I want to use VMware SaltStack Config to schedule the Server Reboot.\nManual Steps:\nCreate a SaltStack Config Job to do the reboot.\nI create a job named \u0026ldquo;vRA | Server Reboot\u0026rdquo;. This job will be used for all scheduled server reboots. Copy the Python Code below and create a ScheduleServerReboot.py file that will be copied to the SSC server. The Python Code completes the following steps:\nCreates a Target that uses the grain \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; and will only target the Server that you want to reboot. Creates a Run Once Schedule to use the job and new target that was created. Sends an email to show that the run once schedule to reboot server was created. SaltStack Config Server: My SaltStack Config Server (SSC) is what VMware provides when using Life Cycle Manager (LCM) running Photon OS.

I never modify the OOTB workflows. I cloned this Workflow and named it \u0026ldquo;Schedule EC2 Reboot\u0026rdquo;.\nOriginal OOTB Workflow from vRO:\nCloned Worked in vRO:\nVery simple form to fill out. Enter EC2 name and Date|Time.\nThe Workflow takes the data from the vRA custom form and does an SSH Connection to the SSC server and runs a single line command using the data from the form as arguments:\npython3 /scripts/ScheduleServerReboot.py -name \u0026lsquo;2019DC\u0026rsquo; -dateTime 2022-06-25T23:00\u0026rsquo;\nI hope the provided code and screenshots were helpful to get you started. Lessons Learned: If you are a Windows Server Admin that knows PowerShell, to start using Python will take some time but the languages are similar. SaltStack Config api is a great way to create Day 2 automation processes in vRA. SaltStack Config - RaaS API Documentation Salt Links I found to be very helpful: SaltStack Cheat Sheet SaltStack Tutorials SaltStack Documentation SaltStack Community Slack Channel Learn vRealize Automation Learn SaltStack Config When I write about vRealize Automation (\"vRA\") I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. SaltStack Config is the same way. I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization/environment will be different. There is no right or wrong way to use Salt. This is a GREAT Tool that is included with your vRealize Suite Advanced/Enterprise license. If you own the vRealize Suite, you own SaltStack Config. If you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

After a quick test in my lab I had the same issue with the newest version of SaltStack Config. DO NOT use this blog post until I get a working version in my lab.\nIf you want to work with the VMware Aria Automation Config API please use this newer Blog Post that I created:\nUnlocking the Potential | VMware Aria Automation Config API This post is to show how to use PowerShell to make RESTful API calls to SaltStack Config. This is something that I have wanted to do for awhile. I could never find any examples in my Google searches, so I took the time to learn how the examples that use curl work and translated that into PowerShell Code. I hope some Windows Server Admins will find this post helpful. I like using salt to do Windows Server Configuration Management more than remote PowerShell. You can run changes against many servers at the exact same time instead of looping thru a list of servers names.\nI am also going to look at use salt-api with vRealize Automation ABX action scripts.\nIn some previous posts I used the POSH-SSH module but when you use the salt-api, the PowerShell Module POSH-SSH is no longer needed.\nConfiguration Changes to the SaltStack Config Server: My SaltStack Config Server (SSC) is what VMware provides when using Life Cycle Manager (LCM) running Photon OS. The following steps are what I needed to do in my Lab environment from the SSC CLI to enable salt-api: * Always make sure you have a good snap | backup before making any changes to SSC Server Install CherryPy: 1 pip3 install cherrypy Install the PyOpenSSL package: 1 pip3 install pyopenssl Generate a self-signed certificate: 1 salt-call --local tls.create_self_signed_cert open firewall port 8000: 1 iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 8000 -j ACCEPT Edit /etc/salt/master file: 1 vi /etc/salt/master Add these lines to the /etc/salt/master file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 external_auth: pam: root: - .* rest_cherrypy: port: 8000 ssl_crt: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt ssl_key: /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.key Restart salt-master and check service status for any errors: 1 2 systemctl restart salt-master systemctl status salt-master Enable | Start salt-api and check service status for any errors: 1 2 3 systemctl enable salt-api systemctl start salt-api systemctl status salt-api Tests to make sure SaltStack Config Changes are working: I did all this PowerShell code from my mac. To use self-signed certs I use -SkipCertificateCheck. On a Windows OS the code is different. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 # --- PowerShell Code --- Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \u0026#39;https://192.168.86.141:8000\u0026#39; -SkipCertificateCheck Results: StatusCode : 200 StatusDescription : OK Content : {\u0026#34;return\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Welcome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;clients\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;local_async\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;local_batch\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;local_subset\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runner\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;runner_async\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ssh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;wheel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;wheel_async\u0026#34;]} RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: CherryPy/8.9.1 Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2022 20:57:46 GMT Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: GET, POST Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Vary: Accept-E… Headers : {[Server, System.String[]], [Date, System.String[]], [Access-Control-Allow-Origin, System.String[]], [Access-Control-Expose-Headers, System.String[]]…} Images : {} InputFields : {} Links : {} RawContentLength : 146 RelationLink : {} Make sure you see StatusCode: 200\nNext step is to make sure you get a token:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 # --- PowerShell Code --- # --- In my code I show the PassWord.

Lessons Learned: OOTB (Out of the Box) a SaltStack Config Server is NOT setup to use CherryPY to use api calls. Using PowerShell Invoke-RestMethod is a great way to automate SaltStack Config. The more I use salt with Windows Servers the more I like how it works. So fast. Many different ways to do automation | configuration Management. To get the proper args for a salt function I always test from the CLI.

I still feel that I barely use all the capabilities that salt has to offer. SaltStack Config is a very Powerful tool to have available for anyone that has a vRealize Suite License. As a Windows Server admin don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid of salt because you feel it was made for Linux admins. That is NOT the case. I will be managing all Windows Server in my environment with salt. That includes VMs in vCenter and cloud native Azure VMs.\nThis cheat sheet will be updated often to show examples as my journey into the salt world continues.

This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and \u0026ldquo;Giving Back\u0026rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.\n2022 is also the 2nd year that I was accepted into the VMware vExpert Cloud Management subprogram.\nI think that 2021 was one of my most productive years and one that I advanced my own personal knowledge the most.\nHighlights of 2021 to get accepted into the vExpert Program: VMworld 2021 session (Presentation): Manage Windows Workloads Through vRealize Automation SaltStack Config [MCL1895] SaltConf21 session (Presentation): Managing Windows with SaltStack Config (6) of my personal Blogs were shared by the VMware “vExpert Cloud Management Community” on the Vmware Blog Web Site. I did several vRealize Automation Presentations at VMware HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) Events. PowerBlock Customer Showcase - VM “Right Sizing” I did a IDC interview for VMware on Automation that will be released in 2022. I did a VMware Customer Reference Interview that will be released in 2022. Link to Customer Reference I shared a vRealize Operations “Right Sizing” Dashboard on the code.vmware.com web site. What is the VMware vExpert Program? Program Overview The VMware vExpert program is VMware\u0026rsquo;s global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware\u0026rsquo;s marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware\u0026rsquo;s roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards. In the application, we consider various community activities from the previous year as well as the current year\u0026rsquo;s (only for 2nd half applications) activities in determining who gets awards. We look to see that not only were you active but are still active in the path you chose to apply for.\nCriteria If you are interested in becoming a vExpert the criteria is simple. We are looking for IT Professionals who are sharing their VMware knowledge and contributing that back to the community. The term \u0026ldquo;giving back\u0026rdquo; is defined as going above and beyond your day job. There are several ways to share your knowledge and engage with the community. Some of those activities are blogging, book authoring, magazine articles, CloudCred task writing, active in Facebook groups, forum (VMTN as well as other non VMware) platforms, public speaking, VMUG leadership, videos and so on.\nThanks: I have worked with a great group of people at VMware, past and present.

The job can run every day, once a week, every 4 hours. Whatever makes sense for your use case. See Screen Shot.

I spent the entire year working from home and I find myself to be more productive when WFH. My wife and I moved into a different home and I now have a dedicated office area on the 2nd floor away from everyone. I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash.\nIn 2021, I started living the \u0026ldquo;Salt Life\u0026rdquo;. In July, I installed SaltStack Config for the first time and started taking a serious look at Salt. I went from zero to doing a presentation about SaltStack at VMworld 2021 in October and another presentation at SaltConf21 in November. Having a session selected for VMworld 2021 was a career \u0026ldquo;Bucket List\u0026rdquo; for me.\nAfter creating a vRealize Operations Dashboard on \u0026ldquo;Right Sizing\u0026rdquo; that I use in production, my vRealize Account Executive setup a meeting for me to meet Iwan \u0026rsquo;e1\u0026rsquo; Rahabok, who is the co-creator of the book \u0026ldquo;Operationalize Your World\u0026rdquo;. Iwan liked the Dashboard I created and included some details about the Dashboard in his book \u0026ldquo;Operationalize Your World\u0026rdquo;.\nI always say if one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful. In 2021, between the presentations and blogs posts, I feel I have given back and helped some people.

I did several vRealize Automation Presentations at VMware HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) Events. PowerBlock Customer Showcase - VM \u0026ldquo;Right Sizing\u0026rdquo; I did a IDC interview for VMware on Automation that will be released in 2022. I did a VMware Customer Reference Interview that will be released in 2022.

I use PowerShell for a lot of Automation, Windows Server and Linux Server. When working with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config I constantly found myself going to the CLI to test and learn how the salt functions work. In the Part 5 Blog of this series I showed how I am using the PowerShell module POSH-SSH to connect to the VMware vRealize SaltStack Config Server to run salt commands remotely. So I started writing some PowerShell functions to run remote salt commands on the Salt Master. The end goal might be to turn this script into a Salt PowerShell Module. To start it will only have the functions that I find myself using the most. I could turn this into a community Github Project and see if there would be any interest. If anyone reading this blog post has any interest please reach out to me. (Dale.Hassinger@vCROCS.info)\nMy goal is to make all these PowerShell Salt functions work with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config like PowerCLI works with VMware vCenter. Use same verb/noun terminology. I use PowerCLI for all my VMware Automation. Works awesome! So to create these PowerShell Functions to work with my existing automation scripts is a win win in my book.\nNormally I will use a Products APIs to do all these types of processes. I looked at VMware vRealize SaltStack Config APIs and to the best of my knowledge I can not use them like I can the PS functions that I created. That may change in a future release of VMware vRealize SaltStack Config.

Using the PowerShell Functions above as a Windows admin makes it very easy to add this code to existing scripts and use the Power of SaltStack without completely changing your processes. Creating a SSH Connection to a remote Salt Master and running commands works well in a \u0026ldquo;Zero Trust\u0026rdquo; environment. With NSX-T all you need to do is setup allow rules between the minions and the master on ports 4505,4506.

I have been spending more time with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config and I have learned some better ways to do some of the processes that I have talked about already. My goal to to learn and use the built-in functions that are already in the product. I found that using the salt functions require less coding and better logging.\nFirst example of changing how I am going to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. When I first started looking at grains I thought I would edit the grains file with PowerShell and add the grains content to the file. What I did worked but I think I learned a better way. There is a function grains.append that will append grains data to the grains file on the minion. This works much better and when I run a job to add grains information it is listed in Activity Completed within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. I like to be able to see when changes are made by the jobs that are run.\nThe code that I have listed below to get vCenter TAGs assigned to a VM and add the information to the minion is using PowerShell. To use this script you MUST install the PowerShell Module POSH-SSH. The process I am showing connects to a vCenter, creates a SSH Connection to the Salt Server, gets all assigned vCenter TAGs for a VM, , runs salt commands to add grain information to the grains file of a minion, and then runs a minion grains sync. This concept can be used for a lot of different systems. If you want to add NSX-T Security TAGs as grain information (Thanks Karl Hauck for this idea), AD (Active Directory) OU of the Windows Server, or anything you think would be useful to Target minions within VMware vRealize SaltStack Config.\nI really like the idea of using POSH-SSH to make the SSH connection to the Salt Master Server and running commands. I do a lot of Automation within vRA (vRealize Automation) with PowerShell and I can use this same concept to use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config to complete the processes that need run. I can also create Catalog items within vRA that you can make available to APP Teams to use. The Catalog item could be running salt jobs in VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. Cool Stuff!\nGrains File: This is what I learned about salt grains when using with a Windows OS.\nThe default location of the grains file is in directory \u0026ldquo;C:\\salt\\conf\u0026quot;. The grains file is named grains with no extension. Example grains file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 NSXSecurityTAGs: - vCROCS.Apps.VMware.SaltStack.Minion vCenterTAGs: - TAG-VM-WebServer - TAG-VM-vCROCS - TAG-App-Hugo \u0026ldquo;Grain Name\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;The value of the grain\u0026rdquo;. In my example I wanted the grain to be named \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo; and the values will be the vCenter TAG names \u0026ldquo;TAG-VM-vCROCS, TAG-VM-WebServer, TAG-App-Hugo\u0026rdquo;. I have (3) vCenter TAGs assigned to this VM. I will be able to create a SaltStack Config Target based on any of the TAGs. I like the formatting that is used for the grains file by using the function grains.append. SaltStack Config Targets: When I add the vCenter TAG information to the grains file I am then able to create SaltStack Config Targets based on the grain \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo;.\nSaltStack Config Targets: SaltStack Config Target Definition: How to add the vCenter TAGs to the grains file on all your VMs in SaltStack Config:\nGet the VM Names and All Assigned vCenter TAGs\nPowerShell Script: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 # ----- [ SSH SaltStack Config Server - Add vCenter TAGs to Minion Grains ] -------------------------- # Connect to vCenter before running this code # Define your Credentials # SSH to SaltStack Server - MUST HAVE POSH-SSH PowerShell Module Installed New-SSHSession -ComputerName \u0026#39;SaltServer.vCROCS.info\u0026#39; # Test SSH Connection $CheckSSHConnection = Get-SSHSession -SessionId 0 $CheckSSHConnection.Connected $vmNames = Get-VM -Name vCROCS-VM-* $vmNames = $vmNames | Sort-Object Name foreach($vmName in $VMNames){ $vmName.Name #Get VM Tag(s) $VMTags = Get-TagAssignment -Entity $vmName.Name $VMTags.Tag.Name foreach($vmTAG in $VMTags.Tag.Name){ $sshCommand = \u0026#39;salt \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmName.Name + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; grains.append vCenterTAGs \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmTAG + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; $results = Invoke-SSHCommand -SessionId 0 -Command $sshCommand } # End Foreach # Sync Grains after adding new grain information $sshCommand = \u0026#39;salt \u0026#34;\u0026#39; + $vmName.Name + \u0026#39;\u0026#34; saltutil.sync_grains\u0026#39; $results = Invoke-SSHCommand -SessionId 0 -Command $sshCommand } # End Foreach # ----- [ Terminate SSH Session ] ----------------------------- Remove-SSHSession -SessionId 0 Lessons Learned: Adding the POSH-SSH PowerShell module so you can create a SSH connection to the salt master opens up a lot of possibilities for your PowerShell Automation as a Windows Server Admin. Grains are a good way to create SaltStack Config Targets. Allows you to group VMs together the same way you can in vCenter. The Grains file is basically a Database that can be any information that you want to show about your VMs. In this Blog post I am adding vCenter TAGs to the minions but the information could be anything that helps you target VMs. If the default list of grains OOTB doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the information you want to see, you can easily add your own gains with a little bit of code.

I have a specific use case that made me start looking at grains. In VMware vCenter I use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs. I also use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs in vRealize Operations. I want to use the same logic of using vCenter TAGs in SaltStack Config. SaltStack Config does not use vCenter TAGs OOTB (Out of the Box) for VMs.\nAt the end of this Blog Post I also have an SaltStack Config Orchestration example. Instead of running multiple Jobs one at a time I have (4) steps in a SLS file that I run using a salt-run job and the function state.orchestrate.\nGrains File: This is what I learned about salt grains when using with a Windows OS.\nThe default location of the grains file is in directory \u0026ldquo;C:\\salt\\conf\u0026quot;. The grains file is named grains with no extension. Example grains file: 1 vCenterTags: TAG-VM-vCROCS|TAG-VM-WebServer|TAG-App-Hugo \u0026ldquo;Grain Name\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;The value of the grain\u0026rdquo;. In my example I wanted the grain to be named \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo; and the values will be the vCenter TAG names \u0026ldquo;TAG-VM-vCROCS|TAG-VM-WebServer|TAG-App-Hugo\u0026rdquo;. I have (3) vCenter TAGs assigned to this VM. I will be able to create a SaltStack Config Target based on any of the TAGs. SaltStack Config Targets: When I add the vCenter TAG information to the grains file I am then able to create SaltStack Config Targets based on the grain \u0026ldquo;vCenterTags\u0026rdquo;.\nSaltStack Config Targets: SaltStack Config Target Definition: How to add the vCenter TAGs to the grains file on all your VMs in SaltStack Config: Step 1: Get the VM Names and All Assigned vCenter TAGs into a csv file Example PowerShell Code to get all vCenter VM Names and all vCenter TAGs assigned to the VMs\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 # ----- [ Start Create CSV File with all VMs/TAGs Assigned ] ---------------------------- # I did not include code to connect to the vCenter. There are many ways to do this step. # Make sure you are connected to the vCenter BEFORE running this code. $allvmstaginfoFile = \u0026#34;C:\\Salt\\allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#34; # Create Array $allVMsTagInfo = @(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) # Add Headers to Array $VMTagInfo = \u0026#39;VM,TAGs\u0026#39; $allVMsTagInfo += $VMTagInfo # Get All VMs in you vCenter $vmNames = Get-VM $vmNames = $vmNames | Sort-Object Name foreach($vmName in $VMNames){ # Get VM Tag(s) $VMTags = Get-TagAssignment -Entity $vmName.Name # If more than (1) TAG I will join them as a string with a \u0026#39;|\u0026#39; separating the values. $VMtags = $VMTags.Tag.Name -join \u0026#39;|\u0026#39; # Create a string with the VMname and all the vCenter TAGs assigned separated by a comma $VMTagInfo = $vmName.Name + \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; + $VMTags # Add Info to array $allVMsTagInfo += $VMTagInfo } # End Foreach # Delete existing all VMs Tag csv File Remove-Item -Path $allvmstaginfoFile # Create new all VMs Tag csv File New-Item $allvmstaginfoFile -ItemType File # Add array Data to CSV file $allVMsTagInfo | Select-Object -Skip 1 | Set-Content $allvmstaginfoFile # ----- [ End Create CSV File with all VMs/TAGs Assigned ] ---------------------------- Step 2: Copy the csv file to the salt master After I create the csv file I copy to the StackStack Config Server (Salt Master) in the folder /var/srv/salt. This is where all files need to be saved when you use function cp.get_file.\nStep 3: Copy the csv file to the salt minions You may be wondering why I copy the file to the minion and not copy to a central share. My environment has NSX-T with zero trust. Most of my automation I do not open ports to servers that are not needed permanently. So the concept of using salt to copy files to minions, use the files to make changes and then delete the files when processes are complete works well in a zero trust environment.\nJob to copy csv file to minions: Step 4: Run Script on minion After I copy the csv file to the minion I run a script to create/update the grains files.\nJob to run a PowerShell Script to create/update the grains file: Example PowerShell Code to create/update grains file on a minion:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 # ----- [ Start Create Grain File with TAGs Assigned ] ---------------------------- $allvmstaginfoFile = \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#34; $grainTagInfo = Import-Csv $allvmstaginfoFile $vmName = hostname $grainsFile = \u0026#34;C:\\salt\\conf\\grains\u0026#34; if (Test-Path $grainsFile) { # Remove existing vCenter Tags $grainsContent = Get-Content $grainsFile $grainsContent = $grainsContent | Where-Object {$_ -notmatch \u0026#34;vCenterTags:\u0026#34;} # If Only grain is vCenter Tags then Delete the grains file and re-create if(!$grainsContent){ Remove-Item -Path $grainsFile New-Item $grainsFile -ItemType File } # End If else{ $grainsContent | Set-Content $grainsFile -Force } # End Else #Get VM Tag(s) $grainfileinfo = $grainTagInfo | Where-Object {$_.VM -eq $vmName} $VMTagInfo = \u0026#39;vCenterTags: \u0026#39; + $grainfileinfo.TAGs Add-Content $grainsFile $VMTagInfo -Force } # End If else{ # Create grains file New-Item $grainsFile -ItemType File #Get VM Tag(s) $grainfileinfo = $grainTagInfo | Where-Object {$_.VM -eq $vmName} # Define Tags String $VMTagInfo = \u0026#39;vCenterTags: \u0026#39; + $grainfileinfo.TAGs # Add Tags to grains file Add-Content $grainsFile $VMTagInfo -Force } # End else # ----- [ End Create Grain File with TAGs Assigned ] ---------------------------- Step 5: Run job to do a sync_grains Anytime you make any changes to the grains file you should run the function saltutil.sync_grains to update the SaltStack Config Server immediately.\nJob to run sync of the minion grains information: SaltStack Config Orchestration: Job to Orchestrate all the steps: Copy file to minion. Run script to create/update grains file Run a sync_grains. Delete the files from the minions when processes are complete. Example Orchestration SLS file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 copy_tags: salt.function: - name: cp.get_file - tgt: \u0026#39;os:Windows\u0026#39; - tgt_type: grain - arg: - \u0026#39;salt://allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\\allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#39; create_grain_file: salt.function: - name: cmd.script - tgt: \u0026#39;os:Windows\u0026#39; - tgt_type: grain - arg: - source=\u0026#34;salt://SEM/grains-vCenter-tags.ps1\u0026#34; - shell=powershell grain_sync: salt.function: - name: saltutil.sync_grains - tgt: \u0026#39;os:Windows\u0026#39; - tgt_type: grain Cleanup_Tag_File: salt.function: - name: file.remove - tgt: \u0026#39;os:Windows\u0026#39; - tgt_type: grain - arg: - \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\\allvmstaginfo.csv\u0026#39; Salt-Run Job to Orchestrate Copy File/Run Script/Run Sync/Delete File: Lessons Learned: Grains are a good way to create SaltStack Config Targets. Allows you to group VMs together the same way you can in vCenter. The Grains file is basically a Database that can be any information that you want to show about your VMs. In this Blog post I am adding vCenter TAGs to the minions but the information could be anything that helps you target VMs. If the default list of grains OOTB doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the information you want to see, you can easily add your own gains with a little bit of code.

How do I NOT allow a Server Admin to login into the server and manually start the service?\nThis is where beacons and reactors work with minion configurations that you want to make permanent. This is the configuration Management Part of Salt Stack. To always make sure a Windows Service is stopped I created a beacon.conf file. On a Windows Server the Beacon.conf needs to be in the \u0026lsquo;C:\\salt\\conf\\minion.d' folder. Anytime a beacon.conf file is added to a minion or modified the salt-minion service needs restarted. I have a salt Job to restart the salt-minion service.\nBeacons: Beacon File: Sends events to the event bus on the salt master from a minion This beacon.conf example is for service state changes.

This blog is a work in progress on my journey with Salt. I started at zero and let\u0026rsquo;s see what I discover as I work towards getting to PROD. So if this topic is interesting to you, check back often.\nI wanted to learn one of the server configuration products that are available like Salt, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc\u0026hellip; but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure which would be the best choice long term. When VMware purchased SaltStack Config the product to choose became a lot easier for me. SaltStack Config is included with vRealize Suite for licensing and I can call VMware support for help, SaltStack Config became the obvious product to pick.\nI like to show how to use VMware vRealize Products from a Windows Server Admin point of view. I do work with both Windows Servers and Linux Servers but most information you see online with Salt is using Linux Servers. I also do most of my current automation with PowerShell scripts. I do not want to lose all the time invested into the logic with my current PowerShell scripts.\nI am not going to go thru the process to install SaltStack Config. There is already some very good blogs written on installing SaltStack Config. One item I would recommend with installing Salt-Stack Config is to use VMware vRealize Life Cycle Manager (\u0026ldquo;LCM\u0026rdquo;). LCM makes the process to install SaltStack Config a lot easier. This Blog is assuming you already installed SaltStack Config, now how do I use salt and what do I use salt for.\nInstalling and Configuring SaltStack Config The first step (minions): After you get a working SaltStack Config Server setup, the first item you need to do is add the salt agent to some \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo; servers. Servers that have the salt agent installed are called minions. There is the option to not add the salt agent to servers but then you need to use SSH to connect. Windows Servers do not have SSH available as default so you would need to install an SSH server like OpenSSH on your servers. My thoughts are I need to add something for the minions to communicate with the salt-master. Instead of adding OpenSSH to every Windows Server I chose to install and use the salt agent.\nFor testing you can manually install the minion agent on a server to become familiar with how the salt commands work. During the install there are two values you need to enter. The name of the master and the name you want to use for the minion. I did that on my first couple test servers but then I created some PowerShell code to install the salt minion agent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 # ----- [ Install minion ] ----------------------------------------------- # Define Username/Password $username = \u0026#39;username@vCROCS.info\u0026#39; # The next line is how to create the encrypted password # Read-Host -Prompt \u0026#34;Enter your password - username\u0026#34; -AsSecureString | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Out-File \u0026#34;C:\\PWkey\\username.key\u0026#34; $password = Get-Content \u0026#34;C:\\PWkey\\username.key\u0026#34; | ConvertTo-SecureString $cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $username, $password # ----- [ This section connects you to vCenter where VM is located ] ----- # Connect to vCenter vCenterName = \u0026#39;vCenter.vCROCS.info\u0026#39; Connect-VIServer $vCenterName -Credential $cred # ----- [ Install Salt Agent ] ------------------------------------------- # Name of Server to install the salt minion agent $vmName = \u0026#39;DBH-217\u0026#39; # Copy the minion agent file to your windows server Copy-VMGuestFile -Source G:\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe -Destination \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\u0026#39; -VM $vmName -LocalToGuest -GuestCredential $cred # command string to install the Salt Minion Agent $PSText = \u0026#39;C:\\vCROCS\\Salt-Minion-2019.2.4-Py3-AMD64-Setup.exe /S /master=salt /minion-name=\u0026#39; + $vmName # Run the command on remote Server Invoke-VMScript -VM $VMName -ScriptType bat -ScriptText $PSText -GuestCredential $cred After the minion agent is installed on your server you need to accept the key on the salt master. From the CLI you can run these commands.\nList all keys. You should see you new minion listed in the Unaccepted Keys: 1 salt-key -L Accept the new minion key on the salt master: 1 salt-key --accept=\u0026#34;DBH-217\u0026#34; If you list all keys again you should see you new minion listed in the Accepted Keys: 1 salt-key -L My next update will include information on how to auto accept new minions.\nHere are some basic salt commands from CLI that I have been using: Show all events:\n1 salt-run state.event Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nShow all events with a \u0026ldquo;Pretty\u0026rdquo; view:\n1 salt-run state.event pretty=true Click Here to see Larger Image of Screen Shot\nList keys:\n1 salt-key -L Accept Key: 1 salt-key --accept=\u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; Delete Key: 1 salt-key -d \u0026#34;DBH-211,DBH-212\u0026#34; Run a function on one minion: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-217\u0026#34; disk.usage Run a function on multiple minions: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-217,DBH-218\u0026#34; test.ping Run a function on all minions: 1 salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; test.ping Create a file: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; file.touch C:\\vCROCS\\salt.tst Copy a file: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; cp.get_file salt://vCROCS/vCROCSTEST.ps1 \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34; Delete a file: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; file.remove \u0026#34;C:\\vCROCS\\vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34; Run a PowerShell Script: 1 salt \u0026#34;DBH-214\u0026#34; cmd.script source=\u0026#34;salt://vCROCS/vCROCSTEST.ps1\u0026#34; shell=powershell Restart the Salt Master Service: 1 service salt-master restart Show the status of the raas and salt-master services: 1 2 systemctl status raas systemctl status salt-master Stop and start the salt-master service: 1 2 systemctl stop salt-master systemctl start salt-master Get IP address of all minions: 1 salt \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; network.ip_addrs Ping All Minions: 1 salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; test.ping Disk Space Usage on all Minions: 1 salt \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; disk.usage Lessons Learned: Anything you can do in the SaltStack Config GUI you can do in CLI. I find myself using the CLI for most testing. After I have the commands correct I will then add into the GUI. DO NOT have the minion agent version newer than the Salt-Master. I am going to try and keep the salt-master and minions always at the same version. The minion can be at an older version than the salt-master. During my upgrade from SaltStack Config 8.3 to 8.4 the Salt API did not upgrade. I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember seeing any errors in LCM after the upgrade. The raas service was at version 8.4 and the salt API was at 8.3. I had authentication issues, I could not accept keys, etc\u0026hellip; I opened an SR with VMware and they helped me fix the issue. The support I received from VMware with Salt was probably the best support I received on any VMware product.

I think this is a metric that you can show to an APP Owner and they can understand why this is important.\nCPU Ready|State (ms): \"Time that the virtual machine was ready, but could not get scheduled to run on the physical CPU during last measurement interval\" vCenter VM Advanced Performance: vCenter VM Advanced Performance Settings: When I looked at vROPS OOTB (Out of the Box) the VM CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) was not being collected. I wanted to be able to show the CPU Metric CPU|Ready (ms) in a Right-Size/Performance Dashboard to show APP Owners this value.\nSteps to add Metric CPU|Ready (ms) to vROPS: Administration: Policies. Select your Default Policy. Edit Policy. Select Object Type: Virtual Machine Filter for the word Ready. Expand the metrics/CPU. You will see Ready (ms) Disabled. Change State and Instanced State to Enabled. Save See the (2) screen shots below. Here is a vROPS Dashboard that I created to show APP Owners Performance information and Right Sizing information in a \"Single Pane of Glass\". A question the APP Owners always ask is WHY should we take resources away from a VM to make the performance better. If you look at the Column CPU|Remove and then look at the column CPU|Ready (ms), the CPU|Ready (ms) is much higher on VMs that are NOT Right Sized. In one Dashboard I am showing several CPU performance metrics, vSAN performance metrics, CPU configuration (Counts/Hot ADD) and Right Sizing. I like to be able to look at all these metrics at the same time. Nice to be able to see if there is a relationship between performance, latency and Right Sizing. Does CPU performance affect the vSAN performance? Here is a VM that CPU|Remove is 0 and the CPU|Ready (ms) is much lower. Why is that? Dashboard Screen Shot:\nVM Names were removed from screen Shot\nClick here to Download Dashboard and Views from VMware Code Web Site\nCPU | Ready (ms) metric after using vROPS Right Size recommendation: This metric chart is showing a VM that had 12 CPU. vROPS recommended that the CPU count be 10. Before VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 1500 - 2000 (ms). After the VM CPU count was changed to 10 you can see the CPU|Ready (ms) was running between 500 - 600 (ms). If you would do this across 100s of VMs in a cluster you would see even more performance gains because then the \u0026ldquo;Noisy Neighbors\u0026rdquo; would not be as Noisy.\nPerformance Values: CPU|Ready (ms) should be 1000 or less for best performance CPU|Remove - I like to keep this at 2 or less. For some applications this can be trial and error. CPU|Add - I like to keep this at 0. Make sure the VM is sized with enough resources. Don\u0026rsquo;t under size VMs. This will keep the APP Owners Happy! The next section was in an IBM KB article that I found helpful: CPU ready time is a vSphere metric that records the amount of time a VM is ready to use CPU but was unable to schedule physical CPU time because all the vSphere ESXi host CPU resources are busy. CPU ready time is dependent on the number of VMs on the host and their CPU loads. It is normal for a VM to average between 0–50 ms of CPU ready time; anything over 1000 ms is considered to lead to VM performance problems.\nVMs that are configured with multiple vCPUs will suffer from an increased amount of ready time than compared to VMs with fewer vCPUs configured. Ready time increases as the VM needs more vCPU resources to be made available at the same time and, therefore, may have to wait for extended times for all the required vCPUS to be free to be made available to the VM with more vCPUs.\nIn Addition to Right Sizing, I also think that Optimizing a VM is important. VMware has a Fling available that I like to use VMware OS Optimization Tool that helps you optimize CPU Settings. Dashboard Tips: Add Color to the list data to make poor performance values catch your eye. (I used Red) Use Donut Charts to show some of the metrics that you feel are more important. To add color to List View values, use Show advanced settings for a metric:\n![](right-size-09.png) Enter the metric values when you want the color to change:\nI like using Donut Charts in Dashboards. You can show a lot of data in a small amount of screen space. Using colors also catches your eye quickly when there are issues:\nWhen I write about Automation I always say there are many ways to accomplish the same task. Monitoring is the same way. I am showing what I felt was important to see but every organization will be different. Add/Remove columns in the Dashboard to suite you needs. There is no right or wrong way to monitor. Maybe other metrics make more sense to you. What is important with monitoring is don\u0026rsquo;t install vRealize Operation and not use it. Don\u0026rsquo;t make vROPS Shelfware! This is a GREAT Tool that shows you so much information about your virtual environment.

There is some documentation available but not a lot of details on how to get and use variables, sdk-objects and bearer token for permission. Here is how I made the vRO REST API calls with PowerShell using vRealize Orchestrator built-into vRA.\nSteps:\nPermission: Need to get a Bearer Token from vRO to make REST API Call to execute Workflow. To get a Bearer Token you need to make an REST API Call with username/password. See example code. Workflow Information: Get Workflow ID. Get Workflow variable inputs. Get sdk-object names from a successful Workflow run. See Screen Shots and sample code. Run the Workflow you want to use REST API with manually at least one time successfully. When you look at the variables of a successful Workflow run it shows you what the Workflow is expecting for variables and sdk-objects. See Screen Shots. Code to get bearer Token (PowerShell): You can\u0026rsquo;t use vRO REST API without getting bearer token first.\n(Note: When vRealize Automation 8.4 was released there was a small change to api to get Bearer Token.

Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I create Windows/Linux VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.x, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell.\nIn my vRA 7.6 environment, I use a PowerShell Host to run processes and on the PowerShell Host is where I install all the PS Modules that I use. When I started looking at how to use PowerShell with vRA 8.2 the one item that I needed to understand was how to use PowerShell Modules. VMware does have a Blog Post on how to include PowerShell modules with ABX Actions/vRO Work Flows - Click Here to see the Blog Post. After doing some testing and reviewing my options I decided to continue to use a PowerShell Host with vRA 8.2. What this allows me to do is use the same exact PowerShell Host for 7.6 and 8.2. The existing PS scripts that I have also work with both 7.6 and 8.2. No changes to any scripts and the PS Host. I like how VMware included PS as an options for all scripts within vRA 8.2. Hopefully in the future VMware will allow you to install your own PS Modules directly in the vRA Appliance. The one item that some people may not like about this setup is it does require an additional Windows Server that a standard vRA setup does not require. But to be able to use an existing Windows PS Host that can be shared between vRA 7.6 and 8.2 until I get my environment to 100% vRA 8.2 also has it positives. With Automation there is always many ways to complete the same task.\nI wrote a Blog Post previously that describes how to pass Cloud Template inputs/properties to ABX Actions. This Post is really using that same technique but instead of only running an ABX Action, this ABX Action Script is passing the inputs/customproperties onto a PowerShell Host. Here is link to previous post: VREALIZE AUTOMATION 8.2 - POWERSHELL ABX. By passing the custom properties as parameters to a PS Host I can also use PS Modules to connect to SQL servers and many other options. Basically any PS Module that is available can be used.\nDetails on how to use a ABX Script with a PowerShell Host: Step 1: Create a Cloud Template. (See included yaml code and screen shot). Create inputs for the parameters you need to send to a PS script that will run on the PS Host. The inputs are the values that are used for the resource/properties. (See included yaml code) Create Properties in the resources section of the yaml for the inputs you just created. These properties will be the parameters that get passed to the PS Script. The properties get passed to the ABX script using $payload. (See included PS code) Step 2: Create a PowerShell ABX Action. (See included PS code and screen shot) To get the custom properties from the Cloud Template you need to use $payload. $payload.customProperties.\"Properties Name\" is how you get the values from the $payload. You can assign the custom properties to a variable within the ABX PS code. I use Invoke-VMScript to run the PS Script on the PS Host because my environment is also a Zero Trust Environment. Invoke-VMScript allows me to run PS scripts on remote servers without opening ports to the remote servers. Step 3: Create a Subscription. See Screenshot. The subscription is want runs the ABX scripts. A subscription can be Fired before or after a compute resource gets provisioned. I create a subscription for both in my environment. Within the subscription is where you define which ABX script is run. If you would want to string several ABX scripts together, the subscription could also run a ABX Flow. Sample Code and Screen Shots: Cloud Template: The properties under resources in the yaml code will be used like parameters in a PS Script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties. When you deploy the Cloud Template, the values entered that I defined will not be used until the ABX script runs. The ABX Script will run after the subscription is triggered. The values will be passed from the Cloud Template to the ABX Script using $payload. Just like passing parameters to a PS script.\nClick to expand code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 # Created by Dale Hassinger - vCrocs.info # Date: 01/14/2021 # Send Property Values to ABX Script that runs script on PS Host with all Zero Trust Permissions and Modules # Version: 1 formatVersion: 1 # ---------- [ Inputs ] ---------- # inputs: cpu: type: integer description: CPUs default: 2 mem: type: integer description: Memory(MB) default: 8192 VMName: type: string title: Enter VM Name minLength: 1 maxLength: 15 default: DBH-001 TemplateName: type: string description: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt; Select Windows or Ubuntu.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; default: vRA_Ubuntu_18.04.4 title: OS oneOf: - title: Ubuntu const: vRA_Ubuntu_18.04.4 - title: Windows 2016 const: vRA_TEMPLATE_2016 - title: Windows 2019 const: vRA_TEMPLATE_2019 CustomizationSpec: type: string default: vRA_Ubuntu description: type: string default: vRA 8.2 TEST VM environment: type: string description: \u0026#39;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt; Select Environment.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#39; default: \u0026#39;environment:Management\u0026#39; title: Environment oneOf: - title: Compute const: \u0026#39;environment:Compute\u0026#39; - title: Management const: \u0026#39;environment:Management\u0026#39; - title: DevTest const: \u0026#39;environment:DevTest\u0026#39; department: type: string description: \u0026lt;b\u0026gt; Select Application Team.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; default: \u0026#39;department:APP Team 1\u0026#39; title: Application Team oneOf: - title: APP Team 1 const: \u0026#39;department:APP Team 1\u0026#39; - title: APP Team 2 const: \u0026#39;department:APP Team 2\u0026#39; - title: APP Team 3 const: \u0026#39;department:APP Team 3\u0026#39; IP: type: string default: 192.168.86.200 emailAddress: type: string default: Dale.Hassinger@vCROCS.info RootPartition: type: integer default: 20 BuildBY: type: string default: DaleHassinger BuildRequestor: type: string default: KirkShaffer OSVersion: type: string default: Ubuntu18044 # ---------- [ Resources ] ---------- # resources: Cloud_Network_1: type: Cloud.Network properties: networkType: existing address: \u0026#39;${input.IP}\u0026#39; constraints: - tag: \u0026#39;${input.environment}\u0026#39; - tag: \u0026#39;${input.department}\u0026#39; Cloud_vSphere_Machine_1: type: Cloud.vSphere.Machine properties: image: \u0026#39;${input.TemplateName}\u0026#39; flavor: std cpu: \u0026#39;${input.cpu}\u0026#39; mem: \u0026#39;${input.mem}\u0026#39; customizationSpec: \u0026#39;${input.CustomizationSpec}\u0026#39; emailAddress: \u0026#39;${input.emailAddress}\u0026#39; RootPartition: \u0026#39;${input.RootPartition}\u0026#39; BuildBY: \u0026#39;${input.BuildBY}\u0026#39; BuildRequestor: \u0026#39;${input.BuildRequestor}\u0026#39; OSVersion: \u0026#39;${input.OSVersion}\u0026#39; constraints: - tag: \u0026#39;${input.environment}\u0026#39; networks: - network: \u0026#39;${resource.Cloud_Network_1.id}\u0026#39; assignment: static address: \u0026#39;${input.IP}\u0026#39; name: \u0026#39;${input.VMName}\u0026#39; description: \u0026#39;${input.description}\u0026#39; ABX Action Script: In my PowerShell code I am using Write-Host to help show how the Cloud Template passes values to the ABX Action using the $payload.

A lot of the PowerShell code and logic I use in vRA 7.6 will be able to be reused/shared. Using a PS Host does require an additional VM. Within ABX scripts I have always changed the default \"Custom limits and retry options\". I set the \"Memory Limit\" to 1024 and \"Timeouts\" to 900. Anytime I speak to others about Automation the one item I stress is there is no right way or wrong way to accomplish your tasks. Build on the skills that your Team already has. The environment I work in is 90% Windows Servers so we use PowerShell a lot. That is why I needed to be able to use all the PS Modules that I have installed on the PS Host.

The one question that almost always gets asked is, how are you able to do everything that you have setup in your environment. After being asked this question a lot I thought I would give my thoughts in a Blog Post. Here is my “Recipe for Success”:\nIngredients: Enjoy what you do. Give Back. Be involved in the vCommunity Enjoy where you work. Enjoy who you work with. Work at a place where management supports you. Don’t be afraid of change. Always keep track of what the industry is doing. Use Social Media like Twitter. Setup a Home Lab Learn, Learn, Learn! Think outside of the box Directions: The most important ingredient is to enjoy what you do. I have worked in the IT industry for 25+ years and I still have a Passion for it. I feel that I get paid to do my hobby. I am fascinated every day when I see some of the new technology that get released. There are some very smart people in the IT industry. I can truly say that I love what do for a job! When I create Automation that makes processes consistent and faster for the Team that I work with, I get a feeling that I have accomplished something. “Feel Good”/’Proud” feeling inside.\nAttend and Participate in user groups. VMUG, “Little Hacks”, SQL, HVC, PowerBlocks, Under The Hoods, etc\u0026hellip; I started out by just attending and learning. I met a lot of people at the user groups. I now consider some of those people friends. After several years of being an attendee, I felt like I wanted to Give Back and start sharing some of the ideas that I have done. So, I started doing presentations myself. Everyone has something to share.\nWork for a Team that isn’t afraid of change. I say tear down the “Silos” and have everyone work together more. I have heard people say that Automation will eliminate my job. If you are an engineer, Automation will get the mundane items off your list. Let you focus more on Engineering type of tasks. The Cool Stuff!\nvRA: Start simple. Don\u0026rsquo;t try and have a 100 processes in your first Catalog item. Keep adding additional steps to the Catalog item until you cross off everything that needs to be done. Prove to management that the simple Automation is working and being used every day. My Automation is in a constant state of change. Always trying to make it better. Constantly including new processes.\nvROPS: Start my making some simple Dashboards with Heat Maps that show the Health of Items. Show your Hosts, VMs, Clusters. Start simple just like I said with Automation. You can then keep adding widgets to the Dashboards to give more information and make them more useful. Look at the \u0026ldquo;Text Display\u0026rdquo; widget to let you show information not included within vROPS. Have a goal of using vROPS as your \u0026ldquo;Single Pane of Glass\u0026rdquo;.\nGo to conferences. In 2020 since almost all conferences were online and free, I attended at least 6. Even if there was only one or two sessions that I wanted to attend, I took the time.\nTwitter is an awesome place to keep up. Use Twitter Lists to keep the “Garbage” out of you feed. I follow a lot of Technology businesses and Bloggers. Find people that have similar interests. Tech Companies are always giving updates about their products on Twitter. They post information about webinars that I find very useful. My Twitter Lists are public if you want to get started.\nSetup a Lab area of some type to be able to learn all the vRealize Products. One way to get a Home Lab started is to use VMware Fusion on Macs or VMware Workstation on PC’s. You can install nested ESXi on Fusion/Workstation.\nI have a Packt subscription that gives me access to a lot of Technology Books on a lot of topics. Well worth the money.\nStarting a Blog is a great way to start #GivingBack. Hugo is a great static site generator. You can use Github at no cost to store and host the web pages generated from Hugo.\n“9 – 5 pays the Bills. 5 – 10 advances your career.”\n#VMware | #vRealizeAuto | #saltstack | #vRealizeOPS | #vmloginsight\n2022 Update: I had to make some changes in 2022. I was starting to miss some of the ingredients that I listed in this Blog post when I originally wrote it so I made a change in my career to get all the ingredients back. When you have a passion for what you do, don\u0026rsquo;t let other people take that drive to keep being successful away. A word that is very important to me is Respect. In my Blog posts I will list people that have helped me in my career. I respect and look up to all those names listed. Life is to short to not have Respect for what you do and have accomplished\u0026hellip;\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

Very important steps need to be followed. All the Web pages to show Citrix Licence counts are updated very hour. The process to update the Web Pages is scheduled with vRealize Automation Orchestrator. The code to get the license information and create the web pages is all done with PowerShell. The License values collected every hour are saved in a Microsoft SQL Database. The process to save the data and create the web pages can be done many different ways. I outlined how I do it in my environment. What I feel was important to show was the finished HTML code to create the ChartJS Web Pages that I display in vRealize Operations. The data could be from any source that makes sense in your environment. This makes a great way to graphically show data within vROPS from data that is saved outside of vROPS.\nLink to my blog post that shows how to use the \u0026ldquo;Test Display Widget\nLink to ChartJS\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the \u0026ldquo;Text Display\u0026rdquo; Widget.\nThe first thought I had was to display the weather for both the data center locations where I work. This could be used with a NOC type Dashboard. I looked online for a weather widget site and got the code to display the weather for the specific locations. If you go to Administration/Configuration/Metric Configurations/TxtWidgetContent you can create html files to save the widget code. See examples in images below. You can display any Widget data from any web site that provides widgets using the \u0026ldquo;Text Display\u0026rdquo; Widget.\nAfter I successfully added weather widgets I wanted to get more serious and show data from a SQL Database. I use a SQL database to store data from some vRealize Automation Day 2 BluePrints that I created. Some example BluePrints where I store data in a SQL DB are Server Builds and Server Decomissions. I created a web page that displayed the SQL Data and added another “Text Display” widget to the Dashboard. I used the url of the web page and assigned it to the widget and now I am also able to show SQL Data on a Dashboard.\nThe reason I wanted to show Weather and SQL data is to use vRealize Operations Dashboards as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring. I have never seen a demo from VMware to use the “Text Display” Widget this way but I think this is awesome. This could completely change the way I use vRealize Operations Dashboards. There are not always vRealize Operations Management Packs available and this provides a cool way to show any data on a Dashboard. The data will be for reference only but it does allow the \u0026ldquo;Single Pane of Glass\u0026rdquo;.\nvRealize Operations Dashboard: Here is a closeup of the Dashboard so you can see the details.\nWidget Code: Administration/Configuration/Metric Configurations/TxtWidgetContent\nHere is a closeup. Create a html file and paste the Widget Code.\nSelect the html file created to show the widget data\nurl Page: The url web page could be a static or dynamic page. Use whatever works best for you. I think this opens up so many possibilities of what you can display on a Custom Dashboard. If you want to take it a step further you could publish the Custom vRealize Operations Dashboard with Workspace One and provide the data to anyone in your organization even if they are not a vRealize Operations user. Cool Shit!\nThe \u0026ldquo;Text Display\u0026rdquo; Widget should be renamed to the \u0026ldquo;Cool Shit\u0026rdquo; Widget!\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

I already had a dedicated office area but it wasn’t setup for full time employment. I always liked a L-Shaped desk and I had this layout by pushing to straight desks together. Worked OK but could use improvement.\nSo I started looking at new desks. I had two requirements, L-Shaped and I also wanted my next desk to be a standup Desk. I reviewed a lot of desks online and I decided to go with the L-Shaped Smart Desk from Autonomous. I am the type of person that usually likes to “touch and feel” this type of purchase to make sure the quality is good but after reviewing what other people were saying about Autonomous I decided to make the purchase. My biggest concern was damage during shipping.\nWhen the desk was delivered I was impressed by how well the desk was packaged. Autonomous does a great job making sure nothing gets damaged. Everything arrived OK and there was no damage or missing pieces. The desk is heavy to put together by yourself. I took my time so I wouldn’t damage anything and the process to assemble was very easy. The directions were good. All the holes in the top are pre-drilled, which make it very nice to align all the pieces. The corners on the top are all slightly rounded and the edges are all eased. That really adds to the look and feel. I was impressed. I’m sure this also helps in shipping so that the top doesn’t get damaged. The quality of the top is so nice that a mouse does not work without a mouse pad. I did have to purchase a mouse pad to use with this desk. A black mouse pad on a black top looks good. I like the wire management included with the desk. I think I will be ordering a couple of the Autonomous Desk Clamp Power Outlets to make wire management even better. All my Apple Space Grey items look good on the Black top. I am anxious to see how often I will use the desk while standing and if I will like to be standing while programming. There is enough room on the L-Shaped desk to hold (3) monitors, (2) Mac Mini’s, external drives, iPad, iPhone, MacBook Pro, AirPods, HomePod, Microsoft Surface Pro, Dell Work Laptop, Shure Mic and a Google Home (Yes I am an Apple Fanboy). Happy with my Smart Desk decision.\nVMware Home Lab: In addition to upgrading my Home Office Desk, it was time to upgrade my VMware Home Lab. My HPE GEN 6 DL380 was not on the VMware supported hardware list anymore and generated a lot of heat and noise in the Home Office.\nI already had an Apple Mac Mini with VMware Fusion installed but it didn’t have a lot of memory installed. I used it to run some small VMs but mainly used the DL380 for my Homelab. So I upgraded the memory on the Mac mini to 64 GB. I also purchased a second Mac Mini and upgraded the memory to 64 GB. So now my Homelab consists of (2) Mac Mini’s with a total of 128 GB memory. I have multiple nested ESXi 7.0 Hosts installed on each Mac Mini using VMware Fusion. The setup has worked well for me so far. No noise and heat like I had with the DL380. Plus I can use the Mac Mini’s for more than just a Homelab. Turn on the ESXi Hosts when needed and then just power off to do my normal everyday computing. If I don’t want to run the VMs on ESXi, I can also just run VMs directly on Fusion.\nSo a month after making my Home Lab work with Apple Mac Mini’s, Apple decides to make all new Apple computers with ARM processors. I guess my next Home Lab upgrade will not be Apple Computers. I will probably look at using Intel NUCs or something like the NUC for my next Home Lab.\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

The setup of the plugin is straight forward; follow the documentation and you’ll likely be set. However, if you use custom DNS views in Infoblox (internal, external, etc.) then some additional configuration is required that’s not easily identified. Out of the box, the Infoblox IPAM integration comes with only a few default properties. I left these values in place when creating my first VM build blueprint but the Infoblox_AllocateIP action would always fail. Action Run logs under the Extensibility tab are a great way to troubleshoot. They were displaying the following error:\nThe fix for this issue is to add a custom property called Infoblox.IPAM.Network.dnsView and set the appropriate value. This property needs to be added in both the integration settings as well as in the blueprint.\nIntegration Settings: Blueprint: Once you complete these steps, you’ll find that the Infoblox_AllocateIP action will successfully complete.\nFor the record, the ability to test deployments without actually kicking off a build is fantastic. I confirmed that the test was accurate by running a deployment and verifying that an IP was assigned and a DNS record was registered.\nHope this helps.\nDan Grove\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

Everyday while driving to and from work I would listen to a Podcast. Anytime I traveled to a conference I would download hours worth of Podcasts to listen to while flying. Most of the Podcasts I listen to are Technology related. Here are some of my favorites:\nIT Reality Virtual Speaking Podcast Develop Great Managers vBrown Bag Automators Mac Power Users Twit Network of Podcasts I have had an interest to be a guest on a Podcast for several years. I always thought to myself, when I get to a point in my career that I could share my knowledge, I would try and be a guest on a Podcast. After doing several presentations about VMware vRealize Automation, I wanted the next step to be a guest spot on a Podcast to reach a larger audience. When I saw a post on Twitter that the IT Reality Podcast was looking for everyday Technology people passionate about a topic and willing to share the knowledge, I reached out to them to show my interest in appearing on their Podcast. We had a meeting and the Hosts felt I had a good story to tell, so we scheduled a time to record the Podcast. The hosts, Vince Wood and Sam Larch, were awesome to work with. They also invited Nathan Bennett to be on the episode as a guest and he was also great to talk with. The experience to talk with these guys was a good way for me to appear on a Podcast. While recording the Podcast I learned some knowledge from Nathan that I will use in my current Automation environment.\nIf it wasn’t for other people sharing knowledge by creating Blogging web sites or appearing on Podcasts, I wouldn’t have the knowledge that I do today. I hope that I can give back to the vCommunity like they have done for me. I would encourage anyone who wants to share their knowledge to Just Do It!

Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I am going to create Windows Server VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.1, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. No vRO (Orchestrator) Workflows will be used. This is completely different compared to how I create Windows Servers with vRA 7.6.\nThe enterprise organizations that I have worked for are 90%+ Microsoft Windows Servers. It is important for me to have vRA be able to create Windows Servers and make all configuration changes using PowerShell.\nYou could also use this technique to make changes to a Linux VM using the PowerCLI commands Invoke-VMscript and Copy-VMGuestFile. I did create a Blog Post on this topic.\nBluePrint Requirements: I want to manually enter the VM Name. I don’t want an auto generated name. After the Windows Server VM is created I want to to able to add vCenter TAGS to VM, make some OS changes, and install software based on values entered on the BluePrint.\nWhat I created to accomplish the requirements: Created a BluePrint. See included code and screen shot.\nCreated a PowerShell Action. See included code and screen shot.\nCreated a Subscription. See Screenshot.\nSample Code and Screen Shots:\u0026mdash; BluePrint: The properties under resources in the yaml code can be used like parameters in a PowerShell script. Since I have a background in PowerShell that is how I am using the properties. When you deploy the BluePrint the values entered that I defined will not be used until the Action runs. The Action will run after the “Compute post provision” event is triggered with the subscription. Those values will be passed from the BluePrint to the Action. Just like passing parameters to a PS script.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 # This is the yaml code for the BluePrint # Created by vCrocs.info formatVersion: 1 inputs: cpuCount: type: integer description: Number of virtual processors default: 2 totalMemoryMB: type: integer description: Machine virtual memory size in Megabytes default: 2048 VMname: type: string default: DBH00 SQL: type: boolean description: Is this a SQL Server? default: false D-Drive-Size: type: integer description: \u0026#39;Enter D:\\ Size in GB\u0026#39; default: 10 minimum: 5 maximum: 50 TEST: type: string enum: - \u0026#39;Yes\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;No\u0026#39; resources: Cloud_vSphere_Machine_1: type: Cloud.vSphere.Machine properties: name: \u0026#39;${input.VMname}\u0026#39; SQL: \u0026#39;${input.SQL}\u0026#39; DDRive: \u0026#39;${input.D-Drive-Size}\u0026#39; imageRef: 2019-TEMPLATE cpuCount: \u0026#39;${input.cpuCount}\u0026#39; totalMemoryMB: \u0026#39;${input.totalMemoryMB}\u0026#39; TEST: \u0026#39;${input.TEST}\u0026#39; constraints: - tag: \u0026#39;quick_start_run:1\u0026#39; \u0026mdash;Using the Inputs Screen helps you build the BluePrint yaml code. I found this very useful since I am still learning the proper yaml formatting.\nAction: In my PowerShell code I am using Write-Host to help me understand how the BluePrint passes values to the Action. I use to troubleshoot and understand how it is working. I am able to take values from the payload customProperties and assign to variables. The customProperties are defined in the BluePrint yaml code as resources/properties. I can then make decisions in the code based on these values.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 # This is the PowerShell code for the Action function handler($context, $payload) { Write-Host \u0026#34;VM Name Created: \u0026#34; $payload.resourceNames[0] Write-Host \u0026#34;D-DRive Size: \u0026#34; $payload.customProperties.DDRive Write-Host \u0026#34;SQL: \u0026#34; $payload.customProperties.SQL $VMname = $payload.resourceNames[0] Write-Host \u0026#34;VM Name Variable: \u0026#34; $VMname $SQL = $payload.customProperties.SQL $DDrive = $payload.customProperties.DDRive #Connect to vCenter Connect-VIServer -server 192.168.1.1 -User \u0026#34;administrator@vsphere.local\u0026#34; -Password \u0026#34;VMware#1\u0026#34; -Protocol https -Force #Assign Tag to new VM New-TagAssignment -Tag \u0026#39;TAG-vRA-Built\u0026#39; -Entity $VMname if($SQL -eq \u0026#39;true\u0026#39;){ New-TagAssignment -Tag \u0026#39;TAG-SQL-Server\u0026#39; -Entity $VMname } # End if return $payload } Subscription: Lets compare vRA 7.6 vs 8.1 vRA 7.6:\nI would create a BluePrint with a custom form in vRA 7.6. I would pass the field values from the custom form as parameters to a PowerShell script on a PowerShell Host.\nvRA 8.1:\nUsing ABX and a subscription in vRA 8.1 eliminates the need to have a Windows PowerShell host and the PowerShell script has no parameters. The vRA 8.x appliance is the PowerShell Host. Less moving parts to complete a Windows Server Build in vRA 8.1.\nLessons Learned: I will need to learn yaml. The process to Create BluePrints will be much different in vRA 8.x. A lot of the PowerShell code and logic I use in vRA 7.6 will be able to be reused. I will not need as many VMs for the installation and administration of vRA 8.x. If you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.

My #1 reason to use PowerShell was because of the PowerCLI PowerShell module that VMware maintains. You can use the PowerCLI module to automate almost all of the VMware Products.\nThere hasn\u0026rsquo;t been any automation process that I have not been able to use PowerShell to automate. PowerShell has a great collection of modules available to use with different products. PowerShell is also easy to use with Products that make APIs available.\nHappy Scripting!\nIf you found this Blog article useful and it helped you, Buy me a coffee to start my day.
