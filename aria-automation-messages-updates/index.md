###### VMware Aria Automation  

Whenever new VMs are deployed or Day 2 operations are executed via the VMware Aria Automation Catalog, I find it crucial to update our team through a common messaging platform about the ongoing creations or modifications. In this blog, I'll demonstrate how to dispatch notifications to both Microsoft Teams and Google Spaces via a Webhook. This technique can be adapted for any messaging service such as Slack, Zoom, Discord, etc., by simply altering the JSON body formatting code and creating a Webhook for message delivery.  

I will guide you through the process of sending alerts from VMware Aria Automation utilizing ABX Actions and Orchestrator Workflows. Though the procedure remains largely the same, there are minor variations in acquiring Property Values. Presenting both methods offers you, the Automation Specialists, the freedom to choose the approach that seamlessly integrates into your workflows. My philosophy in automation is that there are countless ways to achieve the same outcome.  

---

In this blog, I'll walk you through the creation of a new virtual machine (VM). At the onset of the build process, I have configured an Extensibility Subscription that triggers the sending of notifications to both Microsoft Teams and Google Spaces. This is accomplished through the use of an ABX Action and an Orchestrator Workflow.

Besides notifying your team when a new VM is created, I'll demonstrate how to dispatch a message through an Orchestrator Workflow for a Day 2 Automation process.

###### Create a New VM and Send Message

**Steps:**

1. Within the Design section of Aria Automation, create a template. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will construct a straightforward Rocky Linux VM. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-01">Screen Shot 1</a>.
2. Ensure that all properties you wish to include in your notification are incorporated into the template's YAML code. These property values will be transmitted to both ABX Actions and Orchestrator Workflows. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-02">Screen Shot 2</a>.
   - You have the flexibility to include any property in your messages, provided it is specified in the template's YAML code.
3. Proceed to set up an Extensibility Action. | See <a href="#screen-shot-03">Screen Shot 3</a> and <a href="#screen-shot-04">Screen Shot 4</a>.
4. Establish an Extensibility Subscription that will initiate the ABX Action or Orchestrator Workflow as required. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-05">Screen Shot 5</a>.
5. Here's an example of how to define a subscription. | See <a href="#screen-shot-06">Screen Shot 6</a>.
6. Initiate the creation of an Orchestrator Workflow. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-07">Screen Shot 7</a>.
   - Incorporate an input property into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See <a href="#screen-shot-08">Screen Shot 8</a>.
   - Outline the schema within the Orchestrator Workflow. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-09">Screen Shot 9</a>.
   - Inject the necessary code into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See <a href="#screen-shot-10">Screen Shot 10</a> and <a href="#screen-shot-11">Screen Shot 11</a>.
7. Deploy a new VM and confirm that the Extensibility Subscription successfully triggered the ABX Action you defined.
8. Check your preferred messaging system to ensure the notification was received.
   - Example of a Google Spaces Message | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-12">Screen Shot 12</a>.
   - Example of a Microsoft Teams Message | See <a href="#screen-shot-13">Screen Shot 13</a>.
9. If all steps were executed successfully, it's time for a celebration!
10. <a href="#screen-shot-14">Screen Shot 14</a> illustrates the process of creating a Google Spaces Webhook.

###### Orchestrator Workflow Day 2 Automation and Send Message

**Steps:**

1. Initiate the creation of an Orchestrator Workflow. Creating a new Workflow is the same for Day 2 Automation Processes as when a Workflow was created for building a New VM. | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-07">Screen Shot 7</a>.
   - Incorporate an input property into the Orchestrator Workflow for every question needed to complete the Day 2 Automation. | See <a href="#screen-shot-15">Screen Shot 15</a>.
   - Inject the necessary code into the Orchestrator Workflow. | See <a href="#screen-shot-16">Screen Shot 16</a>.
2. Run the Workflow and confirm that the code successfully ran and created the message .
3. Check your preferred messaging system to ensure the notification was received. The Messages with look the same as when you created a New VM. YOU define what information is shown.
   - Example of a Google Spaces Message | Refer to <a href="#screen-shot-12">Screen Shot 12</a>.
   - Example of a Microsoft Teams Message | See <a href="#screen-shot-13">Screen Shot 13</a>.
4. If all steps were executed successfully, it's time for a high five!
5. Example of a Day 2 Automation Microsoft Teams Message | See <a href="#screen-shot-17">Screen Shot 17</a>.

Code Snippets. 
- Each ABX Action starts with identical code to retrieve Property Values.

**Orchestrator Workflow Code:**  

Code Examples. At the start of each Orchestrator Workflow, the code for retrieving Property Values is consistent. The variation comes in how the information is sent to each messaging system.

- For sending messages to Microsoft Teams, use the following code.
- To send a message to Google Spaces in a Workflow, apply the same Google Spaces code used in ABX Actions.
- The Google Spaces code does not change between ABX Actions and Workflows.
- The difference in ABX Actions and Workflows is in the method of obtaining Property Values.

**Orchestrator Workflow Code for Day 2 Automation:**  

Code Example.

- The difference between this Workflow for day 2 Automation Code and when I used a Workflow to create a new VM is how you get the input values.
- For sending messages to Microsoft Teams, use the following code.
- To send a message to Google Spaces in a Workflow, apply the same Google Spaces code used in ABX Actions.
- The Google Spaces code does not change between ABX Actions and Workflows.
- The difference in ABX Actions and Workflows is in the method of obtaining Property Values.
