**GitHub Repository | Code and Examples to help you get started**

Creating a Blog Post every time I want to share a new code example or a new Dashboard Design can take a lot of time. To keep it simple for some items I want to share, I created a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential). This will be a nice way for me to quickly add code more often. So go take a look at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential), and check back often. I will continue to do the more detailed Blog Posts, but I will also add a lot of snippets of code to the repository to share with the vCommunity.
