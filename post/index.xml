      <description>I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this blog as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful.

      <description>Part 8: Pouring the salt grains
My previous posts about grain data were to show how to add minion grain data during the creation of a new server with vRA using PowerShell. This post I want to show how I&amp;rsquo;m going to maintain the grain data that is not default out of the box grain data.
 Windows Server grain data not available out of the of box that I want to add to every minion AND make sure the grain data stays up to date:</description>

      <description>Part 7:
The more I use VMware vRealize SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin the more I see the importance of having grain information added to the minion to be able to target servers many different ways. During a recent discussion it was suggested to have the ability to target Windows Server minions by the Windows server Features|Roles that were installed on the server and by which software was installed on a server.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt; Get-Review 2021  2021 was a good year for me with my career. I spent the entire year working from home and I find myself to be more productive when WFH. My wife and I moved into a different home and I now have a dedicated office area on the 2nd floor away from anyone else. I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash.</description>

        The latest item on my journey with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin is going to be a lot PowerShell. I use PowerShell for a lot of Automation, Windows Server and Linux Server. When working with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config I constantly found myself going to the CLI to test and learn how the salt functions work.</description>

      <description>I will be doing a SaltConf presentation for the first time at SaltConf 2021. I attended SaltConf 2020 for the first time after VMware purchased SaltStack Config. This past year I have spent a lot of time reviewing SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin and I am excited to share what I have learned to hopefully help some Windows Server Admins get started.
I wanted to learn one of the configuration Management products for a couple of years and after VMware purchased SaltStack Config the decision became obvious to me which one I should learn since I live in VMware vRealize Products all day, every day.</description>

      <description>Part 4:
 The latest item on my journey with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin will be salt grains. I have a specific use case that made me start looking at grains. In VMware vCenter I use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs. I also use vCenter TAGs to organize VMs in vRealize Operations. I want to use the same logic of using vCenter TAGs in SaltStack Config.</description>

 The next steps on my journey with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config as a Windows Server Admin will be beacons and reactors. Working with Jobs helped me understand how to make changes Ad-Hoc. I have a Job to quickly stop the Print Spooler but what if I always want the state of the Print Spooler Service to be stopped. How do I NOT allow a Server Admin to login into the server and manually start the service?</description>

      <description>I will be doing a VMworld presentation for the first time at VMworld 2021. I have attended VMworld since 2012 and it has been a goal of mine to do a presentation at a VMworld since the first year I attended. There are always so many good sessions to attend. We are putting many hours into this presentation so that the people attending feel it was worth their time and learn a lot about the topic.</description>

      <description>Part 2:
 I have been able to spend more time with VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. Here are some updates on my journey with SaltStack as a Windows Server Admin.
  Auto-Accept new minions:  I wanted new Windows Server builds (minions) to be auto accepted into SaltStack Config instead of someone manually approving new minions. To do this you need to have a reactor.conf file. I created the file in SaltStack Config File Server in base/reactor/reactor.</description>

      <description>Part 1:
 I have recently started looking at using VMware vRealize SaltStack Config. This blog is a work in progress on my journey with Salt. I started at zero and let&amp;rsquo;s see what I discover as I work towards getting to PROD. So if this topic is interesting to you, check back often.
I wanted to learn one of the server configuration products that are available like Salt, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc&amp;hellip; but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which would be the best choice long term.</description>

      <guid>https://www.vcrocs.info/2021/05/how-vrealize-operations-can-help-with-right-sizing-vms/</guid>
      <description>vRealize Operations does a good job to show you what the correct number for vCPU/Memory settings should be based on monitoring history. But instead of showing APP owners a screen that just shows what the current VM vCPU/Memory settings are and what the new settings &amp;ldquo;Should&amp;rdquo; be, I wanted to show the real data that proves why these changes should be made. It can still be hard for people to understand that taking away a VM resources can make performance better.</description>

      <description>I recently had a use case where I wanted to execute a vRealize Orchestrator Workflow by using REST API. There is some documentation available but not a lot of details on how to get and use variables, sdk-objects and bearer token for permission. Here is how I made the vRO REST API calls with PowerShell using vRealize Orchestrator built-into vRA.
 Steps:
 Permission:  Need to get a Bearer Token from vRO to make REST API Call to execute Workflow.</description>

      <description>PowerShell Code Use PowerShell to see if ports are open to a remote server.
Living in a zero trust environment can be challenging. Here is some code that I have been using to test for open ports from a Windows server to any type of destination. Just change PortNumber and Destination for your use case.
 $PortNumber = &#39;443&#39; $Destination = &#39;Server.vCrocs.info&#39; $socket = New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient $socket.Connect($Destination,$PortNumber) if($socket.Connected){ $PortOpened = &#39;Port: &#39; + $PortNumber + &#39; to &#39; + $Destination +&#39; is Open!</description>

I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert subprogram &amp;ldquo;Cloud Management&amp;rdquo;. This is the first year that I was accepted into the subprogram.
Almost all my blog posts and talks that I give are about one of the vRealize Products. The (2) Products that I use the most are vRealize Automation and Operations but I will be writing about more of the other Products.</description>

      <description>Donut Charts.  This is one of my favorite new features. The donut chart allows you to show a lot of information in a smaller space and makes the Dashboards look more modern and clean looking. I have been replacing the Heat Map Widgets on some of my custom Dashboards with Donut Charts. If you click on the colors of the Donut charts you will then get a list of the data that makes up that color.</description>

Tranquilpeak Hugo Theme
So I changed my Blog site to the new theme. This Theme works well with all the screen sizes and devices. I also like how the Theme automatically shows the order that the &amp;ldquo;Posts&amp;rdquo; and all the &amp;ldquo;TAGs&amp;rdquo; that I assign to each article.</description>

      <description>I like to review VMware vRA (vRealize Automation) 8.2 as a Microsoft Windows Server Admin. Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I create Windows/Linux VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.x, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell.
In my vRA 7.6 environment I use a PowerShell Host to run processes and on the PowerShell Host is where I install all the PS Modules that I use.</description>

The one question that almost always gets asked is how are you able to do everything that you have setup in your environment. After being asked this question a lot I thought I would give my thoughts in a Blog Post. Here is my “Recipe for Success”:

      <description>I like the idea of using VMware vRealize Operations as the “Single Pane of Glass” for all monitoring. The Citrix Team recently asked me if I could show license usage within vRealize Operations. They wanted to see the highest usage in the last 30 days, 10 days and 24 hours. Citrix license usage is not built into vROPS but I have used the “Text Display Widget” to show other information within vROPS.</description>

      <description>I have always be fascinated with everything that you can do with a Raspberry PI. When VMware released their Fling to install ESXi on the Raspberry PI I have become even more fascinated. An ESXi Host for the Home Lab for $50. Sign me up.
During VMworld 2020, VMware announced that they would be releasing a Fling to install ESXi on the Raspberry PI. Before the VMworld session was over I had a new Raspberry PI ordered and it was delivered the next day, ahead of the Fling release, so that I would be ready.</description>

      <title>Text Display Widget - More Powerful than just displaying text on a Dashboard...</title>

      <description>I was recently reviewing some sample custom vRealize Operations Dashboards and I seen where some of the Dashboards had custom text and images. I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the &amp;ldquo;Text Display&amp;rdquo; Widget.</description>

      <description>Smart Desk: Like most people that work in the Technology Field I have been &amp;ldquo;WFH&amp;rdquo; (Working From Home) since the beginning of March. I already had a dedicated office area but it wasn’t setup for full time employment. I always liked a L-Shaped desk and I had this layout by pushing to straight desks together. Worked OK but could use improvement.
So I started looking at new desks. I had two requirements, L-Shaped and I also wanted my next desk to be a standup Desk.</description>

      <description>I recently setup the Infoblox 1.1 plugin for vRA 8.1 and ran into an interesting challenge that I thought I would share. The setup of the plugin is straight forward; follow the documentation and you’ll likely be set. However, if you use custom DNS views in Infoblox (internal, external, etc.) then some additional configuration is required that’s not easily identified. Out of the box, the Infoblox IPAM integration comes with only a few default properties.</description>

      <description>I wanted to review VMware vRA (vRealize Automation) 8.x as a Microsoft Windows Server Admin. Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I am going to create Windows Server VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.1, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. No vRO (Orchestrator) Workflows will be used. This is completely different compared to how I create Windows Servers with vRA 7.</description>

      <description>If you have vRealize Log Insight installed in your environment you need to setup at least one alert that works awesome. When an ESXi Host has an PSOD event, it is difficult in vCenter to see all the HA events of all the VMs that restarted. The events are on the hosts were the VM restarted not the host that had the PSOD. If you have a cluster with a lot of hosts it can take some time to find all the events.</description>

      <description>If you need to set the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost on every ESXI Host in your environment here is some sample PowerCLI code to set the values. Connect to all your vCenters. Get all your hosts. Set the value and then it will reload the syslog service.
The second PowerCLI code example is to get the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost value on every ESXI Host in your environment.</description>

      <description>When working in a Zero Trust Environment and programs are not working the way they should it is nice to have some Tools available to do troubleshooting. When new applications are installed and not working you can be asking yourself is it my issue with the application or is the firewall blocking ports. I recently had a support call with VMware and they showed me two commands that work awesome to test to see if ports are open to a destination IP on a specific port.</description>

      <description>I have reviewed and tried a lot of different ways to create a personal Blog so that I can share Code, Knowledge, Pictures and do Reviews. After spending some time with Hugo it has become the framework that I have liked the most. The Theme &amp;amp;ldquo;Hugo Future Imperfect&amp;amp;rdquo; is also the Hugo Theme that I have liked the most.

Some of the ways I have reviewed creating a Blog require a monthly fee to host the web site for you.</description>

      <description>PowerShell Code There are two PowerCLI commands that have become my best friends in a Zero Trust Environment.
 Invoke-VMScript - Use to run scripts on VMs. Copy-VMGuestFile - Use to copy files to/from VMs.  In this example you can use Invoke-VMScript to run commands on a VM to install Trend Deep Security. All commands run with VM in a zero trust state.
 $VMName = &#39;VM Name&#39; #Copy file to the VM $PSText = &#39;wget https://server01.</description>
