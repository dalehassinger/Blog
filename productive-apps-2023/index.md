**APPs that I use everyday to be Productive | 2023**

<!--more-->

In 2022, I shared a list of apps that were part of my daily routine. This year, I want to reveal the new apps I've incorporated into my workflow and discuss which ones I've moved on from.  

I'm always on the lookout for new apps, so if you have any favorites that I haven't mentioned, please feel free to share them with me. Additionally, if you're curious about how I integrate these apps into my daily routine, reach out to me. I'd be happy to demonstrate their use in a personalized demo.  

My current app selection has been influenced significantly by the VMware/Broadcom merger.
