      <description>If you have vRealize Log Insight installed in your environment you need to setup at least one alert that works awesome. When an ESXi Host has an PSOD event it is hard in vCenter to capture all the VMs that restarted because of the HA event. In Log Insight it is very easy to get alerted of the event and receive an email of all the VMs that restarted. You can then provide your applications Teams with a list of VMs that should be reviewed.</description>
