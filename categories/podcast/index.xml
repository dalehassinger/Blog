<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The <strong>VMware Communities Podcast</strong> has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, <strong>Matt Langguth</strong>, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and &ldquo;Little Hacks&rdquo; hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at <strong>VMware Explore 2023</strong>, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a <strong>Hackathon Team Captain</strong> and talk about the presentation that I did in the <strong>VMware {code} Theater</strong>.</p>
<p>Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a &ldquo;Little Hack&rdquo;, I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>The PowerShell Podcast | I was a Guest on the show</strong></p>

<h6 id="podcast-guest">Podcast Guest:</h6>
<p>I listen to Podcasts all the time. This past year, I started listening to a new podcast, <strong>&ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo;</strong>. This podcast has become one of my favorites that I listen to every week. The hosts (<strong>Andrew Pla</strong> and <strong>Jordan Hammond</strong>) are funny, the content interests me a lot, and the list of guests has been awesome. The guests are people that I have read their books or use their PowerShell Modules to complete automation.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to join the podcast as a guest, to share how I use PowerShell with VMware products. VMware has a PowerShell Module, PowerCLI, that I use with almost all automation that I create. With VMware Aria Automation, you can use PowerShell with Workflows, Actions, and have salt execute PowerShell scripts with state files and functions. So I reached out to the hosts of &ldquo;The PowerShell Podcast&rdquo; and showed my interest to be a guest on the Podcast. They thought that my story would make a good episode, so we scheduled a time to record. The experience to record the podcast episode was great. The behind the scenes was funny. The guests talk to each other the same way they do when when recording an episode. They make you feel comfortable as a guest.</p>
<p>Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.</p>

    <title>What is vRealize Automation - Episode 21</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>IT Reality Podcast</strong></p>
<hr>
<h6 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h6>
<p>I have been listening to Podcasts for many years.  Everyday while driving to and from work I would listen to a Podcast. Anytime I traveled to a conference I would download hours worth of Podcasts to listen to while flying. Most of the Podcasts I listen to are Technology related. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>IT Reality</li>
<li>Virtual Speaking Podcast</li>
<li>Develop Great Managers</li>
<li>vBrown Bag</li>
<li>Automators</li>
<li>Mac Power Users</li>
<li>Twit Network of Podcasts</li>
</ul>
<p>I have had an interest to be a guest on a Podcast for several years.  I always thought to myself, when I get to a point in my career that I could share my knowledge, I would try and be a guest on a Podcast.  After doing several presentations about VMware vRealize Automation, I wanted the next step to be a guest spot on a Podcast to reach a larger audience.  When I saw a post on Twitter that the IT Reality Podcast was looking for everyday Technology people passionate about a topic and willing to share the knowledge, I reached out to them to show my interest in appearing on their Podcast.  We had a meeting and the Hosts felt I had a good story to tell, so we scheduled a time to record the Podcast.  The hosts, Vince Wood and Sam Larch, were awesome to work with. They also invited Nathan Bennett to be on the episode as a guest and he was also great to talk with.  The experience to talk with these guys was a good way for me to appear on a Podcast. While recording the Podcast I learned some knowledge from Nathan that I will use in my current Automation environment.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for other people sharing knowledge by creating Blogging web sites or appearing on Podcasts, I wouldn’t have the knowledge that I do today.  I hope that I can give back to the vCommunity like they have done for me. I would encourage anyone who wants to share their knowledge to Just Do It!  Create a Blogging Web Site or start attending local User Groups and “Little Hacks”. It can be very rewarding.</p>
