      <description>If you need to set the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost on every ESXI Host in your environment here is some sample PowerCLI code to set the values. Connect to all your vCenters. Get all your hosts. Set the value and then it will reload the syslog service.
The second PowerCLI code example is to get the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost value on every ESXI Host in your environment.</description>

      <description>PowerShell Code There are two PowerCLI commands that have become my best friends in a Zero Trust Environment.
 Invoke-VMScript - Use to run scripts on VMs. Copy-VMGuestFile - Use to copy files to/from VMs.  In this example you can use Invoke-VMScript to run commands on a VM to install Trend Deep Security. All commands run with VM in a zero trust state.
 $VMName = &#39;VM Name&#39; #Copy file to the VM $PSText = &#39;wget https://server01.</description>
