    <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Get-Review 2021</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>2021 was a good year for me with my career. I spent the entire year working from home and I find myself to be more productive when WFH. My wife and I moved into a different home and I now have a dedicated office area on the 2nd floor away from everyone. I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash.</p>
<p>In 2021, I started living the &ldquo;Salt Life&rdquo;. In July, I installed SaltStack Config for the first time and started taking a serious look at Salt. I went from zero to doing a presentation about SaltStack at VMworld 2021 in October and another presentation at SaltConf21 in November. Having a session selected for VMworld 2021 was a career &ldquo;Bucket List&rdquo; for me.</p>
<p>After creating a vRealize Operations Dashboard on &ldquo;Right Sizing&rdquo; that I use in production, my vRealize Account Executive setup a meeting for me to meet Iwan &rsquo;e1&rsquo; Rahabok, who is the co-creator of the book &ldquo;Operationalize Your World&rdquo;. Iwan liked the Dashboard I created and included some details about the Dashboard in his book &ldquo;Operationalize Your World&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I always say if one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful. In 2021, between the presentations and blogs posts, I feel I have given back and helped some people. I shared the knowledge.  2021 was a successful year for me.</p>

<ul>
<li>I do a lot of posts on PowerShell and I use it everyday. I want to take some time in 2022 and learn Python. I have done a little bit of Python but not enough to call myself a Python Programmer. I think there are some use cases with vRealize Automation and SaltStack Config that knowing Python may help.</li>
<li>I want to spend more time with Salt. Salt is a powerful tool and I want to expand my knowledge with Salt.</li>
<li>Get a session approved for VMworld 2022 and SaltConf22.</li>
<li>Do more VMware PowerBlock Presentations.</li>
<li>Create more Blog Posts.</li>
<li>Never Stop Learning&hellip;</li>
