      <description>vExpert 2020 - 2022          VMware vExpert 2020 - 2022    I am very proud to be part of the VMware vExpert program. This is the third year that I was accepted into the program. One part of the vExpert program that I think is great is that the program recognizes people for sharing their knowledge and &amp;ldquo;Giving Back&amp;rdquo;. A person selected into the vExpert programs is someone that likes to share, wants to make themselves and everyone around them smarter.</description>
