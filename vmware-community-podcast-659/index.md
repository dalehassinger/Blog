###### Podcast Guest:

I listen to Podcasts all the time. If the Podcast covers VMware Products, you will find it in my playlist and I will listen to all the episodes. The **VMware Communities Podcast** has been on my playlist for many years. I was able to meet a regular co-host on the podcast, **Matt Langguth**, while attending the Central PA VMUG events and "Little Hacks" hosted by a business in the Altoona, PA Area. Matt and I attended a VMware event together in July, in the Pittsburgh, PA area. When I told Matt what was I was going to be involved with at **VMware Explore 2023**, he thought it would make a good podcast episode to share with the vCommunity. I said that I would be happy to join the VMware Communities Podcast and discuss how I was a **Hackathon Team Captain** and talk about the presentation that I did in the **VMware {code} Theater**.  

Matt was also the person that introduced me to the VMware vExpert program. With his encouragement at a "Little Hack", I applied and have been a part of the vExpert program since 2020. The vCommunity has been a great experience for me to meet friends and also advance my career.  

Hopefully the vCommunity enjoys this episode. I thought this would be another great way to give back to the community and share some information.
