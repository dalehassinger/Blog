###### A Comprehensive Guide:

[Christopher Kusek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherkusek/) and I recorded this PowerBlock video to show the vCommunity some of the new VMware Aria Operations features that customers are asking about and using. Watch this video to learn some VMware Aria Operations Tips/Tricks.  

This PowerBlock Agenda was created by conversations we had with VMware Customers. When the customers said, “We didn’t know you could do that”, we knew it was time to do a PowerBlock to share our answers with the vCommunity.  

Take some time and watch the video. We know you will learn some new Tip/Tricks.  

###### Video Content:
* Learn how to set a home Dashboard and give some examples  
* Learn about text display Widget use cases like VMware Cloud Services Status, Zoom Status, Weather  
* Learn how Automation Central can cleanup Snaps and skip VMs if a specific vCenter TAG is added to VM, reboot VMs, Power on/off Cloud Native VMs  
* Learn how to change “Snapshot Age older than” value in Automation Central

###### Thank You:

{{< admonition type=info title=" " open=true >}}
* I want to thank Christopher Kusek for asking me to create this video with him to share on his YouTube Channel.  
* Christopher has been a great mentor for me since I joined VMware. My first week at VMware, before we worked together on the same Team, Christopher reached and out to me and we had a zoom session together. He said I want to make sure you are successful at VMware so here are items to do and look at. Now that we are on the same Team together, he continues to help me everyday. Everyone has someone during your career that makes a impact. Christopher Kusek has made an impact in my career and I will always appreciate his help and be thankful for our friendship.
* Some of the content in this video I learned from others members of my Team. My Team has a Slack channel that we are always helping each other. The culture of my Team is the best I have ever experienced. Everyone wants everyone else to be successful and are always there to lend a helping hand.  
* Thanks to Ron Singler and Aaron Dunbrow for seeing the passion I have for the VMware Aria Suite of Products and allowing me to join the Team I am on at VMware today. To be a Senior Cloud Solutions Architect on the Team that I am a member of has been a great experience.
