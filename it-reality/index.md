I have been listening to Podcasts for many years.  Everyday while driving to and from work I would listen to a Podcast. Anytime I traveled to a conference I would download hours worth of Podcasts to listen to while flying. Most of the Podcasts I listen to are Technology related. Here are some of my favorites:

* IT Reality
* Virtual Speaking Podcast
* Develop Great Managers
* vBrown Bag
* Automators
* Mac Power Users
* Twit Network of Podcasts

I have had an interest to be a guest on a Podcast for several years.  I always thought to myself, when I get to a point in my career that I could share my knowledge, I would try and be a guest on a Podcast.  After doing several presentations about VMware vRealize Automation, I wanted the next step to be a guest spot on a Podcast to reach a larger audience.  When I saw a post on Twitter that the IT Reality Podcast was looking for everyday Technology people passionate about a topic and willing to share the knowledge, I reached out to them to show my interest in appearing on their Podcast.  We had a meeting and the Hosts felt I had a good story to tell, so we scheduled a time to record the Podcast.  The hosts, Vince Wood and Sam Larch, were awesome to work with. They also invited Nathan Bennett to be on the episode as a guest and he was also great to talk with.  The experience to talk with these guys was a good way for me to appear on a Podcast. While recording the Podcast I learned some knowledge from Nathan that I will use in my current Automation environment.  

If it wasn’t for other people sharing knowledge by creating Blogging web sites or appearing on Podcasts, I wouldn’t have the knowledge that I do today.  I hope that I can give back to the vCommunity like they have done for me. I would encourage anyone who wants to share their knowledge to Just Do It!  Create a Blogging Web Site or start attending local User Groups and “Little Hacks”. It can be very rewarding.
