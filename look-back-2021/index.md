# Year in Review - 2021 | 2022 Goals


**Get-Review 2021**

2021 was a good year for me with my career. I spent the entire year working from home and I find myself to be more productive when WFH. My wife and I moved into a different home and I now have a dedicated office area on the 2nd floor away from everyone. I still share my office with Belle (Rescue Dog adopted in 2020 before covid) everyday and she loves the fenced in back yard that she can run around in without a leash.  

In 2021, I started living the "Salt Life". In July, I installed SaltStack Config for the first time and started taking a serious look at Salt. I went from zero to doing a presentation about SaltStack at VMworld 2021 in October and another presentation at SaltConf21 in November. Having a session selected for VMworld 2021 was a career "Bucket List" for me.  

After creating a vRealize Operations Dashboard on "Right Sizing" that I use in production, my vRealize Account Executive setup a meeting for me to meet Iwan 'e1' Rahabok, who is the co-creator of the book "Operationalize Your World". Iwan liked the Dashboard I created and included some details about the Dashboard in his book "Operationalize Your World".  

I always say if one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful. In 2021, between the presentations and blogs posts, I feel I have given back and helped some people. I shared the knowledge.  2021 was a successful year for me.

###### Set-Goals 2022

* I do a lot of posts on PowerShell and I use it everyday. I want to take some time in 2022 and learn Python. I have done a little bit of Python but not enough to call myself a Python Programmer. I think there are some use cases with vRealize Automation and SaltStack Config that knowing Python may help.
* I want to spend more time with Salt. Salt is a powerful tool and I want to expand my knowledge with Salt.
* Get a session approved for VMworld 2022 and SaltConf22.
* Do more VMware PowerBlock Presentations.
* Create more Blog Posts.
* Never Stop Learning...
