###### VMware Explore 2023 Hackathon:  

I will be participating in the VMware Explore 2023 Hackathon. I am the Team Captain for the "Well Spoken" Team. This Blog Post will be documenting the journey of the "Well Spoken" Team.  

I want to thank Senior Staff TAM, [Ariel Sanchez](https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor), for organizing the Team. Originally we were going to be part of Ariel's Team but there were too many people, so we split the Team in half. Ariel asked me to be the Captain of the 2nd Team. If you know Ariel, you know why he had too many people on his team.  Ariel is very active in the #vCommunity and does a great job promoting the #vCommunity. So when he asked on social platforms for people to join his team, there was instantly interest from a lot of people. Ariel has done a lot for me personally since I started working at VMware and I can't wait to meet him in person at the Hackathon.

###### Update 08/25/2023:

The "Well-Spoken" Team got 2nd place at the VMware Explore Hackathon! There was a total of 9 Teams.  

I am so proud of what the "Well-Spoken" Team created together. There was great collaboration throughout the whole process.  

The Team created a custom form in VMware Aria Automation that will help you build a chat question that would be sent to ChatGPT and return complete usable scripts to use with Automation.  The Scirpt returned could then be saved into a Teams/Slack Channel, GitHub Repository or a VMwaqre Aria Operations Dashboard.  

This custom form will help customers get started with Automation and also convert existing Automation, like an Ansible Playbook, into a salt state file.

It would have been nice if the Whole Hackathon Team would have been able to attend the Hackathon. Maybe next year. Fingers crossed...
