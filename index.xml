      <title>vRealize Operations - Dashboards</title>

      <description>I was recently reviewing some sample custom vRealize Operations Dashboards and I seen where some of the Dashboards had custom text and images. I reviewed how they included the text and images and in some of the sample Dashboards they used the “Text Display” Widget and used a url for the content. They would display images saved on a web server. I thought this was interesting and started reviewing what else could be displayed by using a url with the &amp;ldquo;Text Display&amp;rdquo; Widget.</description>

      <description>Smart Desk: Like most people that work in the Technology Field I have been &amp;ldquo;WFH&amp;rdquo; (Working From Home) since the beginning of March. I already had a dedicated office area but it wasn’t setup for full time employment. I always liked a L-Shaped desk and I had this layout by pushing to straight desks together. Worked OK but could use improvement.
So I started looking at new desks. I had two requirements, L-Shaped and I also wanted my next desk to be a standup Desk.</description>

      <title>Infoblox 1.1 plugin for vRA 8.1</title>

      <description>I recently setup the Infoblox 1.1 plugin for vRA 8.1 and ran into an interesting challenge that I thought I would share. The setup of the plugin is straight forward; follow the documentation and you’ll likely be set. However, if you use custom DNS views in Infoblox (internal, external, etc.) then some additional configuration is required that’s not easily identified. Out of the box, the Infoblox IPAM integration comes with only a few default properties.</description>

      <description>I wanted to review VMware vRA (vRealize Automation) 8.x as a Microsoft Windows Server Admin. Most of the reviews you see are creating Linux VMs and customizing the OS using tools for Linux. I am going to create Windows Server VMs and customize the OS using a new feature added to vRA 8.1, Action Based Extensibility (ABX) with PowerShell. No vRO (Orchestrator) Workflows will be used. This is completely different compared to how I create Windows Servers with vRA 7.</description>

      <description>If you have vRealize Log Insight installed in your environment you need to setup at least one alert that works awesome. When an ESXi Host has an PSOD event, it is difficult in vCenter to see all the HA events of all the VMs that restarted. The events are on the hosts were the VM restarted not the host that had the PSOD. If you have a cluster with a lot of hosts it can take some time to find all the events.</description>

      <description>If you need to set the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost on every ESXI Host in your environment here is some sample PowerCLI code to set the values. Connect to all your vCenters. Get all your hosts. Set the value and then it will reload the syslog service.
The second PowerCLI code example is to get the ESXi Host Advanced System Setting Syslog.global.logHost value on every ESXI Host in your environment.</description>

      <description>When working in a Zero Trust Environment and programs are not working the way they should it is nice to have some Tools available to do troubleshooting. When new applications are installed and not working you can be asking yourself is it my issue with the application or is the firewall blocking ports. I recently had a support call with VMware and they showed me two commands that work awesome to test to see if ports are open to a destination IP on a specific port.</description>

      <description>I have reviewed and tried a lot of different ways to create a personal Blog so that I can share Code, Knowledge, Pictures and do Reviews. After spending some time with Hugo it has become the framework that I have liked the most. The Theme &amp;ldquo;Hugo Future Imperfect&amp;rdquo; is also the Hugo Theme that I have liked the most.

Some of the ways I have reviewed creating a Blog require a monthly fee to host the web site for you.</description>

      <description>PowerShell Code There are two PowerCLI commands that have become my best friends in a Zero Trust Environment.
 Invoke-VMScript - Use to run scripts on VMs. Copy-VMGuestFile - Use to copy files to/from VMs.  In this example you can use Invoke-VMScript to run commands on a VM to install Trend Deep Security. All commands run with VM in a zero trust state.
 $VMName = &#39;VM Name&#39; #Copy file to the VM $PSText = &#39;wget https://server01.</description>
