###### Delete old snapshots:  

Adding "Snapshot Name" to "Delete old snapshots" in Automation Central may seem like a small change but it adds a lot of Power to the process. This change allows you to create a Job to run everyday that will delete all Snaps on VMs EXCEPT Snaps that have "DoNotDelete" in the name.

- [x] You could also do the opposite with this process. You can have the job only delete Snapshots where the Snap Name contains the text "AutoDelete".

I prefer using the method to auto delete all old VM snaps, unless you tell me not to. After being a VMware administrator for many years, I have seen to many VMs running with snaps older that 30 days or even with multiple snaps running and each snap 60+ days old. That is NOT best practice. VM Snaps are NOT Backups. Using Automation Central within VMware Aria Operations helps you keep your environment running better and helps you follow some best practice rules.
