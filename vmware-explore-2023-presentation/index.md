I will be doing a VMware Explore 2023 Presentation. I did a virtual VMWorld presentation in 2021 but this will be my first VMware Explore Presentation that I will be doing "Live". There will be many days going into this presentation so that the people attending will feel it was worth their time to learn about the topic. This is an awesome topic that I am very passionate about.  

So register today for VMware Explore 2023 and attend my session.
